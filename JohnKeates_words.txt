Upon a time before the faery broods 
Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods 
Before King Oberon's bright diadem 
Sceptre and mantle clasp'd with dewy gem 
Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns 
From rushes green and brakes and cowslip'd lawns 
The ever smitten Hermes empty left 
His golden throne bent warm on amorous theft 
From high Olympus had he stolen light 
On this side of Jove's clouds to escape the sight 
Of his great summoner and made retreat 
Into a forest on the shores of Crete 
For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt 
A nymph to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt 
At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured 
Pearls while on land they wither'd and adored 
Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont 
And in those meads where sometime she might haunt 
Were strewn rich gifts unknown to any Muse 
Though Fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose 
Ah what a world of love was at her feet 
So Hermes thought and a celestial heat 
Burnt from his winged heels to either ear 
That from a whiteness as the lily clear 
Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair 
Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare 
From vale to vale from wood to wood he flew 
Breathing upon the flowers his passion new 
And wound with many a river to its head 
To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed 
In vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found 
And so he rested on the lonely ground 
Pensive and full of painful jealousies 
Of the Wood Gods and even the very trees 
There as he stood he heard a mournful voice 
Such as once heard in gentle heart destroys 
All pain but pity thus the lone voice spake 
When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake 
When move in a sweet body fit for life 
And love and pleasure and the ruddy strife 
Of hearts and lips Ah miserable me 
The God dove footed glided silently 
Round bush and tree soft brushing in his speed 
The taller grasses and full flowering weed 
Until he found a palpitating snake 
Bright and cirque couchant in a dusky brake 
She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue 
Vermilion spotted golden green and blue 
Striped like a zebra freckled like a pard 
Eyed like a peacock and all crimson barr'd 
And full of silver moons that as she breathed 
Dissolv'd or brighter shone or interwreathed 
Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries 
So rainbow sided touch'd with miseries 
She seem'd at once some penanced lady elf 
Some demon's mistress or the demon's self 
Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire 
Sprinkled with stars like Ariadne's tiar 
Her head was serpent but ah bitter sweet 
She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete 
And for her eyes what could such eyes do there 
But weep and weep that they were born so fair 
As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air 
Her throat was serpent but the words she spake 
Came as through bubbling honey for Love's sake 
And thus while Hermes on his pinions lay 
Like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey 
Fair Hermes crown'd with feathers fluttering light 
I had a splendid dream of thee last night 
I saw thee sitting on a throne of gold 
Among the Gods upon Olympus old 
The only sad one for thou didst not hear 
The soft lute finger'd Muses chaunting clear 
Nor even Apollo when he sang alone 
Deaf to his throbbing throat's long long melodious moan 
I dreamt I saw thee robed in purple flakes 
Break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks 
And swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart 
Strike for the Cretan isle and here thou art 
Too gentle Hermes hast thou found the maid 
Whereat the star of Lethe not delay'd 
His rosy eloquence and thus inquired 
Thou smooth lipp'd serpent surely high inspired 
Thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes 
Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise 
Telling me only where my nymph is fled 
Where she doth breathe Bright planet thou hast said 
Return'd the snake but seal with oaths fair God 
I swear said Hermes by my serpent rod 
And by thine eyes and by thy starry crown 
Light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown 
Then thus again the brilliance feminine 
Too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine 
Free as the air invisibly she strays 
About these thornless wilds her pleasant days 
She tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet 
Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet 
From weary tendrils and bow'd branches green 
She plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen 
And by my power is her beauty veil'd 
To keep it unaffronted unassail'd 
By the love glances of unlovely eyes 
Of Satyrs Fauns and blear'd Silenus' sighs 
Pale grew her immortality for woe 
Of all these lovers and she grieved so 
I took compassion on her bade her steep 
Her hair in weird syrops that would keep 
Her loveliness invisible yet free 
To wander as she loves in liberty 
Thou shalt behold her Hermes thou alone 
If thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon 
Then once again the charmed God began 
An oath and through the serpent's ears it ran 
Warm tremulous devout psalterian 
Ravish'd she lifted her Circean head 
Blush'd a live damask and swift lisping said 
I was a woman let me have once more 
A woman's shape and charming as before 
I love a youth of Corinth O the bliss 
Give me my woman's form and place me where he is 
Stoop Hermes let me breathe upon thy brow 
And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now 
The God on half shut feathers sank serene 
She breath'd upon his eyes and swift was seen 
Of both the guarded nymph near smiling on the green 
It was no dream or say a dream it was 
Real are the dreams of Gods and smoothly pass 
Their pleasures in a long immortal dream 
One warm flush'd moment hovering it might seem 
Dash'd by the wood nymph's beauty so he burn'd 
Then lighting on the printless verdure turn'd 
To the swoon'd serpent and with languid arm 
Delicate put to proof the lythe Caducean charm 
So done upon the nymph his eyes he bent 
Full of adoring tears and blandishment 
And towards her stept she like a moon in wane 
Faded before him cower'd nor could restrain 
Her fearful sobs self folding like a flower 
That faints into itself at evening hour 
But the God fostering her chilled hand 
She felt the warmth her eyelids open'd bland 
And like new flowers at morning song of bees 
Bloom'd and gave up her honey to the lees 
Into the green recessed woods they flew 
Nor grew they pale as mortal lovers do 
Left to herself the serpent now began 
To change her elfin blood in madness ran 
Her mouth foam'd and the grass therewith besprent 
Wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent 
Her eyes in torture fix'd and anguish drear 
Hot glaz'd and wide with lid lashes all sear 
Flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks without one cooling tear 
The colours all inflam'd throughout her train 
She writh'd about convuls'd with scarlet pain 
A deep volcanian yellow took the place 
Of all her milder mooned body's grace 
And as the lava ravishes the mead 
Spoilt all her silver mail and golden brede 
Made gloom of all her frecklings streaks and bars 
Eclips'd her crescents and lick'd up her stars 
So that in moments few she was undrest 
Of all her sapphires greens and amethyst 
And rubious argent of all these bereft 
Nothing but pain and ugliness were left 
Still shone her crown that vanish'd also she 
Melted and disappear'd as suddenly 
And in the air her new voice luting soft 
Cried Lycius gentle Lycius Borne aloft 
With the bright mists about the mountains hoar 
These words dissolv'd Crete's forests heard no more 
Whither fled Lamia now a lady bright 
A full born beauty new and exquisite 
She fled into that valley they pass o'er 
Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas' shore 
And rested at the foot of those wild hills 
The rugged founts of the Peraean rills 
And of that other ridge whose barren back 
Stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack 
South westward to Cleone There she stood 
About a young bird's flutter from a wood 
Fair on a sloping green of mossy tread 
By a clear pool wherein she passioned 
To see herself escap'd from so sore ills 
While her robes flaunted with the daffodils 
Ah happy Lycius for she was a maid 
More beautiful than ever twisted braid 
Or sigh'd or blush'd or on spring flowered lea 
Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy 
A virgin purest lipp'd yet in the lore 
Of love deep learned to the red heart's core 
Not one hour old yet of sciential brain 
To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain 
Define their pettish limits and estrange 
Their points of contact and swift counterchange 
Intrigue with the specious chaos and dispart 
Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art 
As though in Cupid's college she had spent 
Sweet days a lovely graduate still unshent 
And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment 
Why this fair creature chose so fairily 
By the wayside to linger we shall see 
But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse 
And dream when in the serpent prison house 
Of all she list strange or magnificent 
How ever where she will'd her spirit went 
Whether to faint Elysium or where 
Down through tress lifting waves the Nereids fair 
Wind into Thetis' bower by many a pearly stair 
Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine 
Stretch'd out at ease beneath a glutinous pine 
Or where in Pluto's gardens palatine 
Mulciber's columns gleam in far piazzian line 
And sometimes into cities she would send 
Her dream with feast and rioting to blend 
And once while among mortals dreaming thus 
She saw the young Corinthian Lycius 
Charioting foremost in the envious race 
Like a young Jove with calm uneager face 
And fell into a swooning love of him 
Now on the moth time of that evening dim 
He would return that way as well she knew 
To Corinth from the shore for freshly blew 
The eastern soft wind and his galley now 
Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow 
In port Cenchreas from Egina isle 
Fresh anchor'd whither he had been awhile 
To sacrifice to Jove whose temple there 
Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare 
Jove heard his vows and better'd his desire 
For by some freakful chance he made retire 
From his companions and set forth to walk 
Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk 
Over the solitary hills he fared 
Thoughtless at first but ere eve's star appeared 
His phantasy was lost where reason fades 
In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades 
Lamia beheld him coming near more near 
Close to her passing in indifference drear 
His silent sandals swept the mossy green 
So neighbour'd to him and yet so unseen 
She stood he pass'd shut up in mysteries 
His mind wrapp'd like his mantle while her eyes 
Follow'd his steps and her neck regal white 
Turn'd syllabling thus Ah Lycius bright 
And will you leave me on the hills alone 
Lycius look back and be some pity shown 
He did not with cold wonder fearingly 
But Orpheus like at an Eurydice 
For so delicious were the words she sung 
It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long 
And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up 
Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup 
And still the cup was full while he afraid 
Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid 
Due adoration thus began to adore 
Her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure 
Leave thee alone Look back Ah Goddess see 
Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee 
For pity do not this sad heart belie 
Even as thou vanishest so I shall die 
Stay though a Naiad of the rivers stay 
To thy far wishes will thy streams obey 
Stay though the greenest woods be thy domain 
Alone they can drink up the morning rain 
Though a descended Pleiad will not one 
Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune 
Thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine 
So sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine 
Came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade 
Thy memory will waste me to a shade 
For pity do not melt If I should stay 
Said Lamia here upon this floor of clay 
And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough 
What canst thou say or do of charm enough 
To dull the nice remembrance of my home 
Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam 
Over these hills and vales where no joy is 
Empty of immortality and bliss 
Thou art a scholar Lycius and must know 
That finer spirits cannot breathe below 
In human climes and live Alas poor youth 
What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe 
My essence What serener palaces 
Where I may all my many senses please 
And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease 
It cannot be Adieu So said she rose 
Tiptoe with white arms spread He sick to lose 
The amorous promise of her lone complain 
Swoon'd murmuring of love and pale with pain 
The cruel lady without any show 
Of sorrow for her tender favourite's woe 
But rather if her eyes could brighter be 
With brighter eyes and slow amenity 
Put her new lips to his and gave afresh 
The life she had so tangled in her mesh 
And as he from one trance was wakening 
Into another she began to sing 
Happy in beauty life and love and every thing 
A song of love too sweet for earthly lyres 
While like held breath the stars drew in their panting 
fires 
And then she whisper'd in such trembling tone 
As those who safe together met alone 
For the first time through many anguish'd days 
Use other speech than looks bidding him raise 
His drooping head and clear his soul of doubt 
For that she was a woman and without 
Any more subtle fluid in her veins 
Than throbbing blood and that the self same pains 
Inhabited her frail strung heart as his 
And next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss 
Her face so long in Corinth where she said 
She dwelt but half retir'd and there had led 
Days happy as the gold coin could invent 
Without the aid of love yet in content 
Till she saw him as once she pass'd him by 
Where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully 
At Venus' temple porch 'mid baskets heap'd 
Of amorous herbs and flowers newly reap'd 
Late on that eve as 'twas the night before 
The Adonian feast whereof she saw no more 
But wept alone those days for why should she adore 
Lycius from death awoke into amaze 
To see her still and singing so sweet lays 
Then from amaze into delight he fell 
To hear her whisper woman's lore so well 
And every word she spake entic'd him on 
To unperplex'd delight and pleasure known 
Let the mad poets say whate'er they please 
Of the sweets of Fairies Peris Goddesses 
There is not such a treat among them all 
Haunters of cavern lake and waterfall 
As a real woman lineal indeed 
From Pyrrha's pebbles or old Adam's seed 
Thus gentle Lamia judg'd and judg'd aright 
That Lycius could not love in half a fright 
So threw the goddess off and won his heart 
More pleasantly by playing woman's part 
With no more awe than what her beauty gave 
That while it smote still guaranteed to save 
Lycius to all made eloquent reply 
Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh 
And last pointing to Corinth ask'd her sweet 
If 'twas too far that night for her soft feet 
The way was short for Lamia's eagerness 
Made by a spell the triple league decrease 
To a few paces not at all surmised 
By blinded Lycius so in her comprized 
They pass'd the city gates he knew not how 
So noiseless and he never thought to know 
As men talk in a dream so Corinth all 
Throughout her palaces imperial 
And all her populous streets and temples lewd 
Mutter'd like tempest in the distance brew'd 
To the wide spreaded night above her towers 
Men women rich and poor in the cool hours 
Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white 
Companion'd or alone while many a light 
Flared here and there from wealthy festivals 
And threw their moving shadows on the walls 
Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade 
Of some arch'd temple door or dusky colonnade 
Muffling his face of greeting friends in fear 
Her fingers he press'd hard as one came near 
With curl'd gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown 
Slow stepp'd and robed in philosophic gown 
Lycius shrank closer as they met and past 
Into his mantle adding wings to haste 
While hurried Lamia trembled Ah said he 
Why do you shudder love so ruefully 
Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew 
I'm wearied said fair Lamia tell me who 
Is that old man I cannot bring to mind 
His features Lycius wherefore did you blind 
Yourself from his quick eyes Lycius replied 
'Tis Apollonius sage my trusty guide 
And good instructor but to night he seems 
The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams 
While yet he spake they had arrived before 
A pillar'd porch with lofty portal door 
Where hung a silver lamp whose phosphor glow 
Reflected in the slabbed steps below 
Mild as a star in water for so new 
And so unsullied was the marble hue 
So through the crystal polish liquid fine 
Ran the dark veins that none but feet divine 
Could e'er have touch'd there Sounds Aeolian 
Breath'd from the hinges as the ample span 
Of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown 
Some time to any but those two alone 
And a few Persian mutes who that same year 
Were seen about the markets none knew where 
They could inhabit the most curious 
Were foil'd who watch'd to trace them to their house 
And but the flitter winged verse must tell 
For truth's sake what woe afterwards befel 
'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus 
Shut from the busy world of more incredulous 
Love in a hut with water and a crust 
Is Love forgive us cinders ashes dust 
Love in a palace is perhaps at last 
More grievous torment than a hermit's fast 
That is a doubtful tale from faery land 
Hard for the non elect to understand 
Had Lycius liv'd to hand his story down 
He might have given the moral a fresh frown 
Or clench'd it quite but too short was their bliss 
To breed distrust and hate that make the soft voice hiss 
Besides there nightly with terrific glare 
Love jealous grown of so complete a pair 
Hover'd and buzz'd his wings with fearful roar 
Above the lintel of their chamber door 
And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor 
For all this came a ruin side by side 
They were enthroned in the even tide 
Upon a couch near to a curtaining 
Whose airy texture from a golden string 
Floated into the room and let appear 
Unveil'd the summer heaven blue and clear 
Betwixt two marble shafts there they reposed 
Where use had made it sweet with eyelids closed 
Saving a tythe which love still open kept 
That they might see each other while they almost slept 
When from the slope side of a suburb hill 
Deafening the swallow's twitter came a thrill 
Of trumpets Lycius started the sounds fled 
But left a thought a buzzing in his head 
For the first time since first he harbour'd in 
That purple lined palace of sweet sin 
His spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn 
Into the noisy world almost forsworn 
The lady ever watchful penetrant 
Saw this with pain so arguing a want 
Of something more more than her empery 
Of joys and she began to moan and sigh 
Because he mused beyond her knowing well 
That but a moment's thought is passion's passing bell 
Why do you sigh fair creature whisper'd he 
Why do you think return'd she tenderly 
You have deserted me where am I now 
Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow 
No no you have dismiss'd me and I go 
From your breast houseless ay it must be so 
He answer'd bending to her open eyes 
Where he was mirror'd small in paradise 
My silver planet both of eve and morn 
Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn 
While I am striving how to fill my heart 
With deeper crimson and a double smart 
How to entangle trammel up and snare 
Your soul in mine and labyrinth you there 
Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose 
Ay a sweet kiss you see your mighty woes 
My thoughts shall I unveil them Listen then 
What mortal hath a prize that other men 
May be confounded and abash'd withal 
But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical 
And triumph as in thee I should rejoice 
Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth's voice 
Let my foes choke and my friends shout afar 
While through the thronged streets your bridal car 
Wheels round its dazzling spokes The lady's cheek 
Trembled she nothing said but pale and meek 
Arose and knelt before him wept a rain 
Of sorrows at his words at last with pain 
Beseeching him the while his hand she wrung 
To change his purpose He thereat was stung 
Perverse with stronger fancy to reclaim 
Her wild and timid nature to his aim 
Besides for all his love in self despite 
Against his better self he took delight 
Luxurious in her sorrows soft and new 
His passion cruel grown took on a hue 
Fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible 
In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell 
Fine was the mitigated fury like 
Apollo's presence when in act to strike 
The serpent Ha the serpent certes she 
Was none She burnt she lov'd the tyranny 
And all subdued consented to the hour 
When to the bridal he should lead his paramour 
Whispering in midnight silence said the youth 
Sure some sweet name thou hast though by my truth 
I have not ask'd it ever thinking thee 
Not mortal but of heavenly progeny 
As still I do Hast any mortal name 
Fit appellation for this dazzling frame 
Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth 
To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth 
I have no friends said Lamia no not one 
My presence in wide Corinth hardly known 
My parents' bones are in their dusty urns 
Sepulchred where no kindled incense burns 
Seeing all their luckless race are dead save me 
And I neglect the holy rite for thee 
Even as you list invite your many guests 
But if as now it seems your vision rests 
With any pleasure on me do not bid 
Old Apollonius from him keep me hid 
Lycius perplex'd at words so blind and blank 
Made close inquiry from whose touch she shrank 
Feigning a sleep and he to the dull shade 
Of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd 
It was the custom then to bring away 
The bride from home at blushing shut of day 
Veil'd in a chariot heralded along 
By strewn flowers torches and a marriage song 
With other pageants but this fair unknown 
Had not a friend So being left alone 
Lycius was gone to summon all his kin 
And knowing surely she could never win 
His foolish heart from its mad pompousness 
She set herself high thoughted how to dress 
The misery in fit magnificence 
She did so but 'tis doubtful how and whence 
Came and who were her subtle servitors 
About the halls and to and from the doors 
There was a noise of wings till in short space 
The glowing banquet room shone with wide arched grace 
A haunting music sole perhaps and lone 
Supportress of the faery roof made moan 
Throughout as fearful the whole charm might fade 
Fresh carved cedar mimicking a glade 
Of palm and plantain met from either side 
High in the midst in honour of the bride 
Two palms and then two plantains and so on 
From either side their stems branch'd one to one 
All down the aisled place and beneath all 
There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall 
So canopied lay an untasted feast 
Teeming with odours Lamia regal drest 
Silently paced about and as she went 
In pale contented sort of discontent 
Mission'd her viewless servants to enrich 
The fretted splendour of each nook and niche 
Between the tree stems marbled plain at first 
Came jasper pannels then anon there burst 
Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees 
And with the larger wove in small intricacies 
Approving all she faded at self will 
And shut the chamber up close hush'd and still 
Complete and ready for the revels rude 
When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude 
The day appear'd and all the gossip rout 
O senseless Lycius Madman wherefore flout 
The silent blessing fate warm cloister'd hours 
And show to common eyes these secret bowers 
The herd approach'd each guest with busy brain 
Arriving at the portal gaz'd amain 
And enter'd marveling for they knew the street 
Remember'd it from childhood all complete 
Without a gap yet ne'er before had seen 
That royal porch that high built fair demesne 
So in they hurried all maz'd curious and keen 
Save one who look'd thereon with eye severe 
And with calm planted steps walk'd in austere 
'Twas Apollonius something too he laugh'd 
As though some knotty problem that had daft 
His patient thought had now begun to thaw 
And solve and melt 'twas just as he foresaw 
He met within the murmurous vestibule 
His young disciple 'Tis no common rule 
Lycius said he for uninvited guest 
To force himself upon you and infest 
With an unbidden presence the bright throng 
Of younger friends yet must I do this wrong 
And you forgive me Lycius blush'd and led 
The old man through the inner doors broad spread 
With reconciling words and courteous mien 
Turning into sweet milk the sophist's spleen 
Of wealthy lustre was the banquet room 
Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume 
Before each lucid pannel fuming stood 
A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood 
Each by a sacred tripod held aloft 
Whose slender feet wide swerv'd upon the soft 
Wool woofed carpets fifty wreaths of smoke 
From fifty censers their light voyage took 
To the high roof still mimick'd as they rose 
Along the mirror'd walls by twin clouds odorous 
Twelve sphered tables by silk seats insphered 
High as the level of a man's breast rear'd 
On libbard's paws upheld the heavy gold 
Of cups and goblets and the store thrice told 
Of Ceres' horn and in huge vessels wine 
Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine 
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood 
Each shrining in the midst the image of a God 
When in an antichamber every guest 
Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd 
By minist'ring slaves upon his hands and feet 
And fragrant oils with ceremony meet 
Pour'd on his hair they all mov'd to the feast 
In white robes and themselves in order placed 
Around the silken couches wondering 
Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring 
Soft went the music the soft air along 
While fluent Greek a vowel'd undersong 
Kept up among the guests discoursing low 
At first for scarcely was the wine at flow 
But when the happy vintage touch'd their brains 
Louder they talk and louder come the strains 
Of powerful instruments the gorgeous dyes 
The space the splendour of the draperies 
The roof of awful richness nectarous cheer 
Beautiful slaves and Lamia's self appear 
Now when the wine has done its rosy deed 
And every soul from human trammels freed 
No more so strange for merry wine sweet wine 
Will make Elysian shades not too fair too divine 
Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height 
Flush'd were their cheeks and bright eyes double bright 
Garlands of every green and every scent 
From vales deflower'd or forest trees branch rent 
In baskets of bright osier'd gold were brought 
High as the handles heap'd to suit the thought 
Of every guest that each as he did please 
Might fancy fit his brows silk pillow'd at his ease 
What wreath for Lamia What for Lycius 
What for the sage old Apollonius 
Upon her aching forehead be there hung 
The leaves of willow and of adder's tongue 
And for the youth quick let us strip for him 
The thyrsus that his watching eyes may swim 
Into forgetfulness and for the sage 
Let spear grass and the spiteful thistle wage 
War on his temples Do not all charms fly 
At the mere touch of cold philosophy 
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven 
We know her woof her texture she is given 
In the dull catalogue of common things 
Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings 
Conquer all mysteries by rule and line 
Empty the haunted air and gnomed mine 
Unweave a rainbow as it erewhile made 
The tender person'd Lamia melt into a shade 
By her glad Lycius sitting in chief place 
Scarce saw in all the room another face 
Till checking his love trance a cup he took 
Full brimm'd and opposite sent forth a look 
'Cross the broad table to beseech a glance 
From his old teacher's wrinkled countenance 
And pledge him The bald head philosopher 
Had fix'd his eye without a twinkle or stir 
Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride 
Brow beating her fair form and troubling her sweet pride 
Lycius then press'd her hand with devout touch 
As pale it lay upon the rosy couch 
'Twas icy and the cold ran through his veins 
Then sudden it grew hot and all the pains 
Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart 
Lamia what means this Wherefore dost thou start 
Know'st thou that man Poor Lamia answer'd not 
He gaz'd into her eyes and not a jot 
Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal 
More more he gaz'd his human senses reel 
Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs 
There was no recognition in those orbs 
Lamia he cried and no soft toned reply 
The many heard and the loud revelry 
Grew hush the stately music no more breathes 
The myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths 
By faint degrees voice lute and pleasure ceased 
A deadly silence step by step increased 
Until it seem'd a horrid presence there 
And not a man but felt the terror in his hair 
Lamia he shriek'd and nothing but the shriek 
With its sad echo did the silence break 
Begone foul dream he cried gazing again 
In the bride's face where now no azure vein 
Wander'd on fair spaced temples no soft bloom 
Misted the cheek no passion to illume 
The deep recessed vision all was blight 
Lamia no longer fair there sat a deadly white 
Shut shut those juggling eyes thou ruthless man 
Turn them aside wretch or the righteous ban 
Of all the Gods whose dreadful images 
Here represent their shadowy presences 
May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn 
Of painful blindness leaving thee forlorn 
In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright 
Of conscience for their long offended might 
For all thine impious proud heart sophistries 
Unlawful magic and enticing lies 
Corinthians look upon that gray beard wretch 
Mark how possess'd his lashless eyelids stretch 
Around his demon eyes Corinthians see 
My sweet bride withers at their potency 
Fool said the sophist in an under tone 
Gruff with contempt which a death nighing moan 
From Lycius answer'd as heart struck and lost 
He sank supine beside the aching ghost 
Fool Fool repeated he while his eyes still 
Relented not nor mov'd from every ill 
Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day 
And shall I see thee made a serpent's prey 
Then Lamia breath'd death breath the sophist's eye 
Like a sharp spear went through her utterly 
Keen cruel perceant stinging she as well 
As her weak hand could any meaning tell 
Motion'd him to be silent vainly so 
He look'd and look'd again a level No 
A Serpent echoed he no sooner said 
Than with a frightful scream she vanished 
And Lycius' arms were empty of delight 
As were his limbs of life from that same night 
On the high couch he lay his friends came round 
Supported him no pulse or breath they found 
And in its marriage robe the heavy body wound A 
Fair Isabel poor simple Isabel 
Lorenzo a young palmer in Love's eye 
They could not in the self same mansion dwell 
Without some stir of heart some malady 
They could not sit at meals but feel how well 
It soothed each to be the other by 
They could not sure beneath the same roof sleep 
But to each other dream and nightly weep 
With every morn their love grew tenderer 
With every eve deeper and tenderer still 
He might not in house field or garden stir 
But her full shape would all his seeing fill 
And his continual voice was pleasanter 
To her than noise of trees or hidden rill 
Her lute string gave an echo of his name 
She spoilt her half done broidery with the same 
He knew whose gentle hand was at the latch 
Before the door had given her to his eyes 
And from her chamber window he would catch 
Her beauty farther than the falcon spies 
And constant as her vespers would he watch 
Because her face was turn'd to the same skies 
And with sick longing all the night outwear 
To hear her morning step upon the stair 
A whole long month of May in this sad plight 
Made their cheeks paler by the break of June 
To morrow will I bow to my delight 
To morrow will I ask my lady's boon 
O may I never see another night 
Lorenzo if thy lips breathe not love's tune 
So spake they to their pillows but alas 
Honeyless days and days did he let pass 
Until sweet Isabella's untouch'd cheek 
Fell sick within the rose's just domain 
Fell thin as a young mother's who doth seek 
By every lull to cool her infant's pain 
How ill she is said he I may not speak 
And yet I will and tell my love all plain 
If looks speak love laws I will drink her tears 
And at the least 'twill startle off her cares 
So said he one fair morning and all day 
His heart beat awfully against his side 
And to his heart he inwardly did pray 
For power to speak but still the ruddy tide 
Stifled his voice and puls'd resolve away 
Fever'd his high conceit of such a bride 
Yet brought him to the meekness of a child 
Alas when passion is both meek and wild 
So once more he had wak'd and anguished 
A dreary night of love and misery 
If Isabel's quick eye had not been wed 
To every symbol on his forehead high 
She saw it waxing very pale and dead 
And straight all flush'd so lisped tenderly 
Lorenzo here she ceas'd her timid quest 
But in her tone and look he read the rest 
O Isabella I can half perceive 
That I may speak my grief into thine ear 
If thou didst ever any thing believe 
Believe how I love thee believe how near 
My soul is to its doom I would not grieve 
Thy hand by unwelcome pressing would not fear 
Thine eyes by gazing but I cannot live 
Another night and not my passion shrive 
Love thou art leading me from wintry cold 
Lady thou leadest me to summer clime 
And I must taste the blossoms that unfold 
In its ripe warmth this gracious morning time 
So said his erewhile timid lips grew bold 
And poesied with hers in dewy rhyme 
Great bliss was with them and great happiness 
Grew like a lusty flower in June's caress 
Parting they seem'd to tread upon the air 
Twin roses by the zephyr blown apart 
Only to meet again more close and share 
The inward fragrance of each other's heart 
She to her chamber gone a ditty fair 
Sang of delicious love and honey'd dart 
He with light steps went up a western hill 
And bade the sun farewell and joy'd his fill 
All close they met again before the dusk 
Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil 
All close they met all eyes before the dusk 
Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil 
Close in a bower of hyacinth and musk 
Unknown of any free from whispering tale 
Ah better had it been for ever so 
Than idle ears should pleasure in their woe 
Were they unhappy then It cannot be 
Too many tears for lovers have been shed 
Too many sighs give we to them in fee 
Too much of pity after they are dead 
Too many doleful stories do we see 
Whose matter in bright gold were best be read 
Except in such a page where Theseus' spouse 
Over the pathless waves towards him bows 
But for the general award of love 
The little sweet doth kill much bitterness 
Though Dido silent is in under grove 
And Isabella's was a great distress 
Though young Lorenzo in warm Indian clove 
Was not embalm'd this truth is not the less 
Even bees the little almsmen of spring bowers 
Know there is richest juice in poison flowers 
With her two brothers this fair lady dwelt 
Enriched from ancestral merchandize 
And for them many a weary hand did swelt 
In torched mines and noisy factories 
And many once proud quiver'd loins did melt 
In blood from stinging whip with hollow eyes 
Many all day in dazzling river stood 
To take the rich ored driftings of the flood 
For them the Ceylon diver held his breath 
And went all naked to the hungry shark 
For them his ears gush'd blood for them in death 
The seal on the cold ice with piteous bark 
Lay full of darts for them alone did seethe 
A thousand men in troubles wide and dark 
Half ignorant they turn'd an easy wheel 
That set sharp racks at work to pinch and peel 
Why were they proud Because their marble founts 
Gush'd with more pride than do a wretch's tears 
Why were they proud Because fair orange mounts 
Were of more soft ascent than lazar stairs 
Why were they proud Because red lin'd accounts 
Were richer than the songs of Grecian years 
Why were they proud again we ask aloud 
Why in the name of Glory were they proud 
Yet were these Florentines as self retired 
In hungry pride and gainful cowardice 
As two close Hebrews in that land inspired 
Paled in and vineyarded from beggar spies 
The hawks of ship mast forests the untired 
And pannier'd mules for ducats and old lies 
Quick cat's paws on the generous stray away 
Great wits in Spanish Tuscan and Malay 
How was it these same ledger men could spy 
Fair Isabella in her downy nest 
How could they find out in Lorenzo's eye 
A straying from his toil Hot Egypt's pest 
Into their vision covetous and sly 
How could these money bags see east and west 
Yet so they did and every dealer fair 
Must see behind as doth the hunted hare 
O eloquent and famed Boccaccio 
Of thee we now should ask forgiving boon 
And of thy spicy myrtles as they blow 
And of thy roses amorous of the moon 
And of thy lilies that do paler grow 
Now they can no more hear thy ghittern's tune 
For venturing syllables that ill beseem 
The quiet glooms of such a piteous theme 
Grant thou a pardon here and then the tale 
Shall move on soberly as it is meet 
There is no other crime no mad assail 
To make old prose in modern rhyme more sweet 
But it is done succeed the verse or fail 
To honour thee and thy gone spirit greet 
To stead thee as a verse in English tongue 
An echo of thee in the north wind sung 
These brethren having found by many signs 
What love Lorenzo for their sister had 
And how she lov'd him too each unconfines 
His bitter thoughts to other well nigh mad 
That he the servant of their trade designs 
Should in their sister's love be blithe and glad 
When 'twas their plan to coax her by degrees 
To some high noble and his olive trees 
And many a jealous conference had they 
And many times they bit their lips alone 
Before they fix'd upon a surest way 
To make the youngster for his crime atone 
And at the last these men of cruel clay 
Cut Mercy with a sharp knife to the bone 
For they resolved in some forest dim 
To kill Lorenzo and there bury him 

So on a pleasant morning as he leant 
Into the sun rise o'er the balustrade 
Of the garden terrace towards him they bent 
Their footing through the dews and to him said 
You seem there in the quiet of content 
Lorenzo and we are most loth to invade 
Calm speculation but if you are wise 
Bestride your steed while cold is in the skies 

To day we purpose ay this hour we mount 
To spur three leagues towards the Apennine 
Come down we pray thee ere the hot sun count 
His dewy rosary on the eglantine 
Lorenzo courteously as he was wont 
Bow'd a fair greeting to these serpents' whine 
And went in haste to get in readiness 
With belt and spur and bracing huntsman's dress 

And as he to the court yard pass'd along 
Each third step did he pause and listen'd oft 
If he could hear his lady's matin song 
Or the light whisper of her footstep soft 
And as he thus over his passion hung 
He heard a laugh full musical aloft 
When looking up he saw her features bright 
Smile through an in door lattice all delight 

Love Isabel said he I was in pain 
Lest I should miss to bid thee a good morrow 
Ah what if I should lose thee when so fain 
I am to stifle all the heavy sorrow 
Of a poor three hours' absence but we'll gain 
Out of the amorous dark what day doth borrow 
Goodbye I'll soon be back Goodbye said she 
And as he went she chanted merrily 

So the two brothers and their murder'd man 
Rode past fair Florence to where Arno's stream 
Gurgles through straiten'd banks and still doth fan 
Itself with dancing bulrush and the bream 
Keeps head against the freshets Sick and wan 
The brothers' faces in the ford did seem 
Lorenzo's flush with love They pass'd the water 
Into a forest quiet for the slaughter 

There was Lorenzo slain and buried in 
There in that forest did his great love cease 
Ah when a soul doth thus its freedom win 
It aches in loneliness is ill at peace 
As the break covert blood hounds of such sin 
They dipp'd their swords in the water and did tease 
Their horses homeward with convulsed spur 
Each richer by his being a murderer 

They told their sister how with sudden speed 
Lorenzo had ta'en ship for foreign lands 
Because of some great urgency and need 
In their affairs requiring trusty hands 
Poor Girl put on thy stifling widow's weed 
And 'scape at once from Hope's accursed bands 
To day thou wilt not see him nor to morrow 
And the next day will be a day of sorrow 

She weeps alone for pleasures not to be 
Sorely she wept until the night came on 
And then instead of love O misery 
She brooded o'er the luxury alone 
His image in the dusk she seem'd to see 
And to the silence made a gentle moan 
Spreading her perfect arms upon the air 
And on her couch low murmuring Where O where 
But Selfishness Love's cousin held not long 
Its fiery vigil in her single breast 
She fretted for the golden hour and hung 
Upon the time with feverish unrest 
Not long for soon into her heart a throng 
Of higher occupants a richer zest 
Came tragic passion not to be subdued 
And sorrow for her love in travels rude 
In the mid days of autumn on their eves 
The breath of Winter comes from far away 
And the sick west continually bereaves 
Of some gold tinge and plays a roundelay 
Of death among the bushes and the leaves 
To make all bare before he dares to stray 
From his north cavern So sweet Isabel 
By gradual decay from beauty fell 
Because Lorenzo came not Oftentimes 
She ask'd her brothers with an eye all pale 
Striving to be itself what dungeon climes 
Could keep him off so long They spake a tale 
Time after time to quiet her Their crimes 
Came on them like a smoke from Hinnom's vale 
And every night in dreams they groan'd aloud 
To see their sister in her snowy shroud 
And she had died in drowsy ignorance 
But for a thing more deadly dark than all 
It came like a fierce potion drunk by chance 
Which saves a sick man from the feather'd pall 
For some few gasping moments like a lance 
Waking an Indian from his cloudy hall 
With cruel pierce and bringing him again 
Sense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain 
It was a vision In the drowsy gloom 
The dull of midnight at her couch's foot 
Lorenzo stood and wept the forest tomb 
Had marr'd his glossy hair which once could shoot 
Lustre into the sun and put cold doom 
Upon his lips and taken the soft lute 
From his lorn voice and past his loamed ears 
Had made a miry channel for his tears 
Strange sound it was when the pale shadow spake 
For there was striving in its piteous tongue 
To speak as when on earth it was awake 
And Isabella on its music hung 
Languor there was in it and tremulous shake 
As in a palsied Druid's harp unstrung 
And through it moan'd a ghostly under song 
Like hoarse night gusts sepulchral briars among 
Its eyes though wild were still all dewy bright 
With love and kept all phantom fear aloof 
From the poor girl by magic of their light 
The while it did unthread the horrid woof 
Of the late darken'd time the murderous spite 
Of pride and avarice the dark pine roof 
In the forest and the sodden turfed dell 
Where without any word from stabs he fell 
Saying moreover Isabel my sweet 
Red whortle berries droop above my head 
And a large flint stone weighs upon my feet 
Around me beeches and high chestnuts shed 
Their leaves and prickly nuts a sheep fold bleat 
Comes from beyond the river to my bed 
Go shed one tear upon my heather bloom 
And it shall comfort me within the tomb 
I am a shadow now alas alas 
Upon the skirts of human nature dwelling 
Alone I chant alone the holy mass 
While little sounds of life are round me knelling 
And glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass 
And many a chapel bell the hour is telling 
Paining me through those sounds grow strange to me 
And thou art distant in Humanity 
I know what was I feel full well what is 
And I should rage if spirits could go mad 
Though I forget the taste of earthly bliss 
That paleness warms my grave as though I had 
A Seraph chosen from the bright abyss 
To be my spouse thy paleness makes me glad 
Thy beauty grows upon me and I feel 
A greater love through all my essence steal 
The Spirit mourn'd Adieu dissolv'd and left 
The atom darkness in a slow turmoil 
As when of healthful midnight sleep bereft 
Thinking on rugged hours and fruitless toil 
We put our eyes into a pillowy cleft 
And see the spangly gloom froth up and boil 
It made sad Isabella's eyelids ache 
And in the dawn she started up awake 
Ha ha said she I knew not this hard life 
I thought the worst was simple misery 
I thought some Fate with pleasure or with strife 
Portion'd us happy days or else to die 
But there is crime a brother's bloody knife 
Sweet Spirit thou hast school'd my infancy 
I'll visit thee for this and kiss thine eyes 
And greet thee morn and even in the skies 
When the full morning came she had devised 
How she might secret to the forest hie 
How she might find the clay so dearly prized 
And sing to it one latest lullaby 
How her short absence might be unsurmised 
While she the inmost of the dream would try 
Resolv'd she took with her an aged nurse 
And went into that dismal forest hearse 
See as they creep along the river side 
How she doth whisper to that aged Dame 
And after looking round the champaign wide 
Shows her a knife What feverous hectic flame 
Burns in thee child What good can thee betide 
That thou should'st smile again The evening came 
And they had found Lorenzo's earthy bed 
The flint was there the berries at his head 
Who hath not loiter'd in a green church yard 
And let his spirit like a demon mole 
Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard 
To see scull coffin'd bones and funeral stole 
Pitying each form that hungry Death hath marr'd 
And filling it once more with human soul 
Ah this is holiday to what was felt 
When Isabella by Lorenzo knelt 
She gaz'd into the fresh thrown mould as though 
One glance did fully all its secrets tell 
Clearly she saw as other eyes would know 
Pale limbs at bottom of a crystal well 
Upon the murderous spot she seem'd to grow 
Like to a native lily of the dell 
Then with her knife all sudden she began 
To dig more fervently than misers can 
Soon she turn'd up a soiled glove whereon 
Her silk had play'd in purple phantasies 
She kiss'd it with a lip more chill than stone 
And put it in her bosom where it dries 
And freezes utterly unto the bone 
Those dainties made to still an infant's cries 
Then 'gan she work again nor stay'd her care 
But to throw back at times her veiling hair 

That old nurse stood beside her wondering 
Until her heart felt pity to the core 
At sight of such a dismal labouring 
And so she kneeled with her locks all hoar 
And put her lean hands to the horrid thing 
Three hours they labour'd at this travail sore 
At last they felt the kernel of the grave 
And Isabella did not stamp and rave 
Ah wherefore all this wormy circumstance 
Why linger at the yawning tomb so long 
O for the gentleness of old Romance 
The simple plaining of a minstrel's song 
Fair reader at the old tale take a glance 
For here in truth it doth not well belong 
To speak O turn thee to the very tale 
And taste the music of that vision pale 
With duller steel than the Perséan sword 
They cut away no formless monster's head 
But one whose gentleness did well accord 
With death as life The ancient harps have said 
Love never dies but lives immortal Lord 
If Love impersonate was ever dead 
Pale Isabella kiss'd it and low moan'd 
'Twas love cold dead indeed but not dethroned 

In anxious secrecy they took it home 
And then the prize was all for Isabel 
She calm'd its wild hair with a golden comb 
And all around each eye's sepulchral cell 
Pointed each fringed lash the smeared loam 
With tears as chilly as a dripping well 
She drench'd away and still she comb'd and kept 
Sighing all day and still she kiss'd and wept 

Then in a silken scarf sweet with the dews 
Of precious flowers pluck'd in Araby 
And divine liquids come with odorous ooze 
Through the cold serpent pipe refreshfully 
She wrapp'd it up and for its tomb did choose 
A garden pot wherein she laid it by 
And cover'd it with mould and o'er it set 
Sweet Basil which her tears kept ever wet 
And she forgot the stars the moon and sun 
And she forgot the blue above the trees 
And she forgot the dells where waters run 
And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze 
She had no knowledge when the day was done 
And the new morn she saw not but in peace 
Hung over her sweet Basil evermore 
And moisten'd it with tears unto the core 
And so she ever fed it with thin tears 
Whence thick and green and beautiful it grew 
So that it smelt more balmy than its peers 
Of Basil tufts in Florence for it drew 
Nurture besides and life from human fears 
From the fast mouldering head there shut from view 
So that the jewel safely casketed 
Came forth and in perfumed leafits spread 

O Melancholy linger here awhile 
O Music Music breathe despondingly 
O Echo Echo from some sombre isle 
Unknown Lethean sigh to us O sigh 
Spirits in grief lift up your heads and smile 
Lift up your heads sweet Spirits heavily 
And make a pale light in your cypress glooms 
Tinting with silver wan your marble tombs 
Moan hither all ye syllables of woe 
From the deep throat of sad Melpomene 
Through bronzed lyre in tragic order go 
And touch the strings into a mystery 
Sound mournfully upon the winds and low 
For simple Isabel is soon to be 
Among the dead She withers like a palm 
Cut by an Indian for its juicy balm 
O leave the palm to wither by itself 
Let not quick Winter chill its dying hour 
It may not be those Baälites of pelf 
Her brethren noted the continual shower 
From her dead eyes and many a curious elf 
Among her kindred wonder'd that such dower 
Of youth and beauty should be thrown aside 
By one mark'd out to be a Noble's bride 

And furthermore her brethren wonder'd much 
Why she sat drooping by the Basil green 
And why it flourish'd as by magic touch 
Greatly they wonder'd what the thing might mean 
They could not surely give belief that such 
A very nothing would have power to wean 
Her from her own fair youth and pleasures gay 
And even remembrance of her love's delay 

Therefore they watch'd a time when they might sift 
This hidden whim and long they watch'd in vain 
For seldom did she go to chapel shrift 
And seldom felt she any hunger pain 
And when she left she hurried back as swift 
As bird on wing to breast its eggs again 
And patient as a hen bird sat her there 
Beside her Basil weeping through her hair 
Yet they contriv'd to steal the Basil pot 
And to examine it in secret place 
The thing was vile with green and livid spot 
And yet they knew it was Lorenzo's face 
The guerdon of their murder they had got 
And so left Florence in a moment's space 
Never to turn again Away they went 
With blood upon their heads to banishment 

O Melancholy turn thine eyes away 
O Music Music breathe despondingly 
O Echo Echo on some other day 
From isles Lethean sigh to us O sigh 
Spirits of grief sing not your Well a way 
For Isabel sweet Isabel will die 
Will die a death too lone and incomplete 
Now they have ta'en away her Basil sweet 
Piteous she look'd on dead and senseless things 
Asking for her lost Basil amorously 
And with melodious chuckle in the strings 
Of her lorn voice she oftentimes would cry 
After the Pilgrim in his wanderings 
To ask him where her Basil was and why 
'Twas hid from her For cruel 'tis said she 
To steal my Basil pot away from me 
And so she pined and so she died forlorn 
Imploring for her Basil to the last 
No heart was there in Florence but did mourn 
In pity of her love so overcast 
And a sad ditty of this story born 
From mouth to mouth through all the country pass'd 
Still is the burthen sung O cruelty 
To steal my Basil pot away from me 
St Agnes' Eve Ah bitter chill it was 
The owl for all his feathers was a cold 
The hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass 
And silent was the flock in woolly fold 
Numb were the Beadsman's fingers while he told 
His rosary and while his frosted breath 
Like pious incense from a censer old 
Seem'd taking flight for heaven without a death 
Past the sweet Virgin's picture while his prayer he saith 
His prayer he saith this patient holy man 
Then takes his lamp and riseth from his knees 
And back returneth meagre barefoot wan 
Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees 
The sculptur'd dead on each side seem to freeze 
Emprison'd in black purgatorial rails 
Knights ladies praying in dumb orat'ries 
He passeth by and his weak spirit fails 
To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails 
Northward he turneth through a little door 
And scarce three steps ere Music's golden tongue 
Flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor 
But no already had his deathbell rung 
The joys of all his life were said and sung 
His was harsh penance on St Agnes' Eve 
Another way he went and soon among 
Rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve 
And all night kept awake for sinners' sake to grieve 
That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft 
And so it chanc'd for many a door was wide 
From hurry to and fro Soon up aloft 
The silver snarling trumpets 'gan to chide 
The level chambers ready with their pride 
Were glowing to receive a thousand guests 
The carved angels ever eager eyed 
Star'd where upon their heads the cornice rests 
With hair blown back and wings put cross wise on their breasts 
At length burst in the argent revelry 
With plume tiara and all rich array 
Numerous as shadows haunting fairily 
The brain new stuff'd in youth with triumphs gay 
Of old romance These let us wish away 
And turn sole thoughted to one Lady there 
Whose heart had brooded all that wintry day 
On love and wing'd St Agnes' saintly care 
As she had heard old dames full many times declare 
They told her how upon St Agnes' Eve 
Young virgins might have visions of delight 
And soft adorings from their loves receive 
Upon the honey'd middle of the night 
If ceremonies due they did aright 
As supperless to bed they must retire 
And couch supine their beauties lily white 
Nor look behind nor sideways but require 
Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire 
Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline 
The music yearning like a God in pain 
She scarcely heard her maiden eyes divine 
Fix'd on the floor saw many a sweeping train 
Pass by she heeded not at all in vain 
Came many a tiptoe amorous cavalier 
And back retir'd not cool'd by high disdain 
But she saw not her heart was otherwhere 
She sigh'd for Agnes' dreams the sweetest of the year 
She danc'd along with vague regardless eyes 
Anxious her lips her breathing quick and short 
The hallow'd hour was near at hand she sighs 
Amid the timbrels and the throng'd resort 
Of whisperers in anger or in sport 
'Mid looks of love defiance hate and scorn 
Hoodwink'd with faery fancy all amort 
Save to St Agnes and her lambs unshorn 
And all the bliss to be before to morrow morn 
So purposing each moment to retire 
She linger'd still Meantime across the moors 
Had come young Porphyro with heart on fire 
For Madeline Beside the portal doors 
Buttress'd from moonlight stands he and implores 
All saints to give him sight of Madeline 
But for one moment in the tedious hours 
That he might gaze and worship all unseen 
Perchance speak kneel touch kiss in sooth such things 
have been 
He ventures in let no buzz'd whisper tell 
All eyes be muffled or a hundred swords 
Will storm his heart Love's fev'rous citadel 
For him those chambers held barbarian hordes 
Hyena foemen and hot blooded lords 
Whose very dogs would execrations howl 
Against his lineage not one breast affords 
Him any mercy in that mansion foul 
Save one old beldame weak in body and in soul 
Ah happy chance the aged creature came 
Shuffling along with ivory headed wand 
To where he stood hid from the torch's flame 
Behind a broad hall pillar far beyond 
The sound of merriment and chorus bland 
He startled her but soon she knew his face 
And grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand 
Saying Mercy Porphyro hie thee from this place 
They are all here to night the whole blood thirsty race 
Get hence get hence there's dwarfish Hildebrand 
He had a fever late and in the fit 
He cursed thee and thine both house and land 
Then there's that old Lord Maurice not a whit 
More tame for his gray hairs Alas me flit 
Flit like a ghost away Ah Gossip dear 
We're safe enough here in this arm chair sit 
And tell me how Good Saints not here not here 
Follow me child or else these stones will be thy bier 

He follow'd through a lowly arched way 
Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume 
And as she mutter'd Well a well a day 
He found him in a little moonlight room 
Pale lattic'd chill and silent as a tomb 
Now tell me where is Madeline said he 
O tell me Angela by the holy loom 
Which none but secret sisterhood may see 
When they St Agnes' wool are weaving piously 
St Agnes Ah it is St Agnes' Eve 
Yet men will murder upon holy days 
Thou must hold water in a witch's sieve 
And be liege lord of all the Elves and Fays 
To venture so it fills me with amaze 
To see thee Porphyro St Agnes' Eve 
God's help my lady fair the conjuror plays 
This very night good angels her deceive 
But let me laugh awhile I've mickle time to grieve 
Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon 
While Porphyro upon her face doth look 
Like puzzled urchin on an aged crone 
Who keepeth clos'd a wond'rous riddle book 
As spectacled she sits in chimney nook 
But soon his eyes grew brilliant when she told 
His lady's purpose and he scarce could brook 
Tears at the thought of those enchantments cold 
And Madeline asleep in lap of legends old 
Sudden a thought came like a full blown rose 
Flushing his brow and in his pained heart 
Made purple riot then doth he propose 
A stratagem that makes the beldame start 
A cruel man and impious thou art 
Sweet lady let her pray and sleep and dream 
Alone with her good angels far apart 
From wicked men like thee Go go I deem 
Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem 
I will not harm her by all saints I swear 
Quoth Porphyro O may I ne'er find grace 
When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer 
If one of her soft ringlets I displace 
Or look with ruffian passion in her face 
Good Angela believe me by these tears 
Or I will even in a moment's space 
Awake with horrid shout my foemen's ears 
And beard them though they be more fang'd than wolves and 
bears 
Ah why wilt thou affright a feeble soul 
A poor weak palsy stricken churchyard thing 
Whose passing bell may ere the midnight toll 
Whose prayers for thee each morn and evening 
Were never miss'd Thus plaining doth she bring 
A gentler speech from burning Porphyro 
So woful and of such deep sorrowing 
That Angela gives promise she will do 
Whatever he shall wish betide her weal or woe 

Which was to lead him in close secrecy 
Even to Madeline's chamber and there hide 
Him in a closet of such privacy 
That he might see her beauty unespied 
And win perhaps that night a peerless bride 
While legion'd fairies pac'd the coverlet 
And pale enchantment held her sleepy eyed 
Never on such a night have lovers met 
Since Merlin paid his Demon all the monstrous debt 
It shall be as thou wishest said the Dame 
All cates and dainties shall be stored there 
Quickly on this feast night by the tambour frame 
Her own lute thou wilt see no time to spare 
For I am slow and feeble and scarce dare 
On such a catering trust my dizzy head 
Wait here my child with patience kneel in prayer 
The while Ah thou must needs the lady wed 
Or may I never leave my grave among the dead 
So saying she hobbled off with busy fear 
The lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd 
The dame return'd and whisper'd in his ear 
To follow her with aged eyes aghast 
From fright of dim espial Safe at last 
Through many a dusky gallery they gain 
The maiden's chamber silken hush'd and chaste 
Where Porphyro took covert pleas'd amain 
His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain 
Her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade 
Old Angela was feeling for the stair 
When Madeline St Agnes' charmed maid 
Rose like a mission'd spirit unaware 
With silver taper's light and pious care 
She turn'd and down the aged gossip led 
To a safe level matting Now prepare 
Young Porphyro for gazing on that bed 
She comes she comes again like ring dove fray'd and fled 
Out went the taper as she hurried in 
Its little smoke in pallid moonshine died 
She clos'd the door she panted all akin 
To spirits of the air and visions wide 
No uttered syllable or woe betide 
But to her heart her heart was voluble 
Paining with eloquence her balmy side 
As though a tongueless nightingale should swell 
Her throat in vain and die heart stifled in her dell 
A casement high and triple arch'd there was 
All garlanded with carven imag'ries 
Of fruits and flowers and bunches of knot grass 
And diamonded with panes of quaint device 
Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes 
As are the tiger moth's deep damask'd wings 
And in the midst 'mong thousand heraldries 
And twilight saints and dim emblazonings 
A shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings 

Full on this casement shone the wintry moon 
And threw warm gules on Madeline's fair breast 
As down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon 
Rose bloom fell on her hands together prest 
And on her silver cross soft amethyst 
And on her hair a glory like a saint 
She seem'd a splendid angel newly drest 
Save wings for heaven Porphyro grew faint 
She knelt so pure a thing so free from mortal taint 
Anon his heart revives her vespers done 
Of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees 
Unclasps her warmed jewels one by one 
Loosens her fragrant boddice by degrees 
Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees 
Half hidden like a mermaid in sea weed 
Pensive awhile she dreams awake and sees 
In fancy fair St Agnes in her bed 
But dares not look behind or all the charm is fled 
Soon trembling in her soft and chilly nest 
In sort of wakeful swoon perplex'd she lay 
Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd 
Her soothed limbs and soul fatigued away 
Flown like a thought until the morrow day 
Blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain 
Clasp'd like a missal where swart Paynims pray 
Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain 
As though a rose should shut and be a bud again 
Stol'n to this paradise and so entranced 
Porphyro gazed upon her empty dress 
And listen'd to her breathing if it chanced 
To wake into a slumberous tenderness 
Which when he heard that minute did he bless 
And breath'd himself then from the closet crept 
Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness 
And over the hush'd carpet silent stept 
And 'tween the curtains peep'd where lo how fast she 
slept 
Then by the bed side where the faded moon 
Made a dim silver twilight soft he set 
A table and half anguish'd threw thereon 
A cloth of woven crimson gold and jet 
O for some drowsy Morphean amulet 
The boisterous midnight festive clarion 
The kettle drum and far heard clarionet 
Affray his ears though but in dying tone 
The hall door shuts again and all the noise is gone 
And still she slept an azure lidded sleep 
In blanched linen smooth and lavender'd 
While he from forth the closet brought a heap 
Of candied apple quince and plum and gourd 
With jellies soother than the creamy curd 
And lucent syrops tinct with cinnamon 
Manna and dates in argosy transferr'd 
From Fez and spiced dainties every one 
From silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon 
These delicates he heap'd with glowing hand 
On golden dishes and in baskets bright 
Of wreathed silver sumptuous they stand 
In the retired quiet of the night 
Filling the chilly room with perfume light 
And now my love my seraph fair awake 
Thou art my heaven and I thine eremite 
Open thine eyes for meek St Agnes' sake 
Or I shall drowse beside thee so my soul doth ache 
Thus whispering his warm unnerved arm 
Sank in her pillow Shaded was her dream 
By the dusk curtains 'twas a midnight charm 
Impossible to melt as iced stream 
The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam 
Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies 
It seem'd he never never could redeem 
From such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes 
So mus'd awhile entoil'd in woofed phantasies 
Awakening up he took her hollow lute 
Tumultuous and in chords that tenderest be 
He play'd an ancient ditty long since mute 
In Provence call'd La belle dame sans mercy 
Close to her ear touching the melody 
Wherewith disturb'd she utter'd a soft moan 
He ceased she panted quick and suddenly 
Her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone 
Upon his knees he sank pale as smooth sculptured stone 
Her eyes were open but she still beheld 
Now wide awake the vision of her sleep 
There was a painful change that nigh expell'd 
The blisses of her dream so pure and deep 
At which fair Madeline began to weep 
And moan forth witless words with many a sigh 
While still her gaze on Porphyro would keep 
Who knelt with joined hands and piteous eye 
Fearing to move or speak she look'd so dreamingly 
Ah Porphyro said she but even now 
Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear 
Made tuneable with every sweetest vow 
And those sad eyes were spiritual and clear 
How chang'd thou art how pallid chill and drear 
Give me that voice again my Porphyro 
Those looks immortal those complainings dear 
Oh leave me not in this eternal woe 
For if thou diest my Love I know not where to go 
Beyond a mortal man impassion'd far 
At these voluptuous accents he arose 
Ethereal flush'd and like a throbbing star 
Seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose 
Into her dream he melted as the rose 
Blendeth its odour with the violet 
Solution sweet meantime the frost wind blows 
Like Love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet 
Against the window panes St Agnes' moon hath set 
'Tis dark quick pattereth the flaw blown sleet 
This is no dream my bride my Madeline 
'Tis dark the iced gusts still rave and beat 
No dream alas alas and woe is mine 
Porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine 
Cruel what traitor could thee hither bring 
I curse not for my heart is lost in thine 
Though thou forsakest a deceived thing 
A dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing 
My Madeline sweet dreamer lovely bride 
Say may I be for aye thy vassal blest 
Thy beauty's shield heart shap'd and vermeil dyed 
Ah silver shrine here will I take my rest 
After so many hours of toil and quest 
A famish'd pilgrim saved by miracle 
Though I have found I will not rob thy nest 
Saving of thy sweet self if thou think'st well 
To trust fair Madeline to no rude infidel 
Hark 'tis an elfin storm from faery land 
Of haggard seeming but a boon indeed 
Arise arise the morning is at hand 
The bloated wassaillers will never heed 
Let us away my love with happy speed 
There are no ears to hear or eyes to see 
Drown'd all in Rhenish and the sleepy mead 
Awake arise my love and fearless be 
For o'er the southern moors I have a home for thee 
She hurried at his words beset with fears 
For there were sleeping dragons all around 
At glaring watch perhaps with ready spears 
Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found 
In all the house was heard no human sound 
A chain droop'd lamp was flickering by each door 
The arras rich with horseman hawk and hound 
Flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar 
And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor 
They glide like phantoms into the wide hall 
Like phantoms to the iron porch they glide 
Where lay the Porter in uneasy sprawl 
With a huge empty flaggon by his side 
The wakeful bloodhound rose and shook his hide 
But his sagacious eye an inmate owns 
By one and one the bolts full easy slide 
The chains lie silent on the footworn stones 
The key turns and the door upon its hinges groans 
And they are gone ay ages long ago 
These lovers fled away into the storm 
That night the Baron dreamt of many a woe 
And all his warrior guests with shade and form 
Of witch and demon and large coffin worm 
Were long be nightmar'd Angela the old 
Died palsy twitch'd with meagre face deform 
The Beadsman after thousand aves told 
For aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold 
My heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains 
My sense as though of hemlock I had drunk 
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains 
One minute past and Lethe wards had sunk 
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot 
But being too happy in thine happiness 
That thou light winged Dryad of the trees 
In some melodious plot 
Of beechen green and shadows numberless 
Singest of summer in full throated ease 

O for a draught of vintage that hath been 
Cool'd a long age in the deep delved earth 
Tasting of Flora and the country green 
Dance and Provençal song and sunburnt mirth 
O for a beaker full of the warm South 
Full of the true the blushful Hippocrene 
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim 
And purple stained mouth 
That I might drink and leave the world unseen 
And with thee fade away into the forest dim 

Fade far away dissolve and quite forget 
What thou among the leaves hast never known 
The weariness the fever and the fret 
Here where men sit and hear each other groan 
Where palsy shakes a few sad last gray hairs 
Where youth grows pale and spectre thin and dies 
Where but to think is to be full of sorrow 
And leaden eyed despairs 
Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes 
Or new Love pine at them beyond to morrow 

Away away for I will fly to thee 
Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards 
But on the viewless wings of Poesy 
Though the dull brain perplexes and retards 
Already with thee tender is the night 
And haply the Queen Moon is on her throne 
Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays 
But here there is no light 
Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown 
Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways 

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet 
Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs 
But in embalmed darkness guess each sweet 
Wherewith the seasonable month endows 
The grass the thicket and the fruit tree wild 
White hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine 
Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves 
And mid May's eldest child 
The coming musk rose full of dewy wine 
The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves 

Darkling I listen and for many a time 
I have been half in love with easeful Death 
Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme 
To take into the air my quiet breath 
Now more than ever seems it rich to die 
To cease upon the midnight with no pain 
While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad 
In such an ecstasy 
Still wouldst thou sing and I have ears in vain 
To thy high requiem become a sod 

Thou wast not born for death immortal Bird 
No hungry generations tread thee down 
The voice I hear this passing night was heard 
In ancient days by emperor and clown 
Perhaps the self same song that found a path 
Through the sad heart of Ruth when sick for home 
She stood in tears amid the alien corn 
The same that oft times hath 
Charm'd magic casements opening on the foam 
Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn 

Forlorn the very word is like a bell 
To toll me back from thee to my sole self 
Adieu the fancy cannot cheat so well 
As she is fam'd to do deceiving elf 
Adieu adieu thy plaintive anthem fades 
Past the near meadows over the still stream 
Up the hill side and now 'tis buried deep 
In the next valley glades 
Was it a vision or a waking dream 
Fled is that music Do I wake or sleep 
Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness 
Thou foster child of silence and slow time 
Sylvan historian who canst thus express 
A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme 
What leaf fring'd legend haunts about thy shape 
Of deities or mortals or of both 
In Tempe or the dales of Arcady 
What men or gods are these What maidens loth 
What mad pursuit What struggle to escape 
What pipes and timbrels What wild ecstasy 

Heard melodies are sweet but those unheard 
Are sweeter therefore ye soft pipes play on 
Not to the sensual ear but more endear'd 
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone 
Fair youth beneath the trees thou canst not leave 
Thy song nor ever can those trees be bare 
Bold Lover never never canst thou kiss 
Though winning near the goal yet do not grieve 
She cannot fade though thou hast not thy bliss 
For ever wilt thou love and she be fair 

Ah happy happy boughs that cannot shed 
Your leaves nor ever bid the Spring adieu 
And happy melodist unwearied 
For ever piping songs for ever new 
More happy love more happy happy love 
For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd 
For ever panting and for ever young 
All breathing human passion far above 
That leaves a heart high sorrowful and cloy'd 
A burning forehead and a parching tongue 

Who are these coming to the sacrifice 
To what green altar O mysterious priest 
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies 
And all her silken flanks with garlands drest 
What little town by river or sea shore 
Or mountain built with peaceful citadel 
Is emptied of this folk this pious morn 
And little town thy streets for evermore 
Will silent be and not a soul to tell 
Why thou art desolate can e'er return 

O Attic shape Fair attitude with brede 
Of marble men and maidens overwrought 
With forest branches and the trodden weed 
Thou silent form dost tease us out of thought 
As doth eternity Cold Pastoral 
When old age shall this generation waste 
Thou shalt remain in midst of other woe 
Than ours a friend to man to whom thou say'st 
Beauty is truth truth beauty that is all 
Ye know on earth and all ye need to know 
O Goddess hear these tuneless numbers wrung 
By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear 
And pardon that thy secrets should be sung 
Even into thine own soft conched ear 
Surely I dreamt to day or did I see 
The winged Psyche with awaken'd eyes 
I wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly 
And on the sudden fainting with surprise 
Saw two fair creatures couched side by side 
In deepest grass beneath the whisp'ring roof 
Of leaves and trembled blossoms where there ran 
A brooklet scarce espied 
'Mid hush'd cool rooted flowers fragrant eyed 
Blue silver white and budded Tyrian 
They lay calm breathing on the bedded grass 
Their arms embraced and their pinions too 
Their lips touch'd not but had not bade adieu 
As if disjoined by soft handed slumber 
And ready still past kisses to outnumber 
At tender eye dawn of aurorean love 
The winged boy I knew 
But who wast thou O happy happy dove 
His Psyche true 
O latest born and loveliest vision far 
Of all Olympus' faded hierarchy 
Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire region'd star 
Or Vesper amorous glow worm of the sky 
Fairer than these though temple thou hast none 
Nor altar heap'd with flowers 
Nor virgin choir to make delicious moan 
Upon the midnight hours 
No voice no lute no pipe no incense sweet 
From chain swung censer teeming 
No shrine no grove no oracle no heat 
Of pale mouth'd prophet dreaming 
O brightest though too late for antique vows 
Too too late for the fond believing lyre 
When holy were the haunted forest boughs 
Holy the air the water and the fire 
Yet even in these days so far retir'd 
From happy pieties thy lucent fans 
Fluttering among the faint Olympians 
I see and sing by my own eyes inspired 
So let me be thy choir and make a moan 
Upon the midnight hours 
Thy voice thy lute thy pipe thy incense sweet 
From swinged censer teeming 
Thy shrine thy grove thy oracle thy heat 
Of pale mouth'd prophet dreaming 
Yes I will be thy priest and build a fane 
In some untrodden region of my mind 
Where branched thoughts new grown with pleasant pain 
Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind 
Far far around shall those dark cluster'd trees 
Fledge the wild ridged mountains steep by steep 
And there by zephyrs streams and birds and bees 
The moss lain Dryads shall be lull'd to sleep 
And in the midst of this wide quietness 
A rosy sanctuary will I dress 
With the wreath'd trellis of a working brain 
With buds and bells and stars without a name 
With all the gardener Fancy e'er could feign 
Who breeding flowers will never breed the same 
And there shall be for thee all soft delight 
That shadowy thought can win 
A bright torch and a casement ope at night 
To let the warm Love in 
Ever let the Fancy roam 
Pleasure never is at home 
At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth 
Like to bubbles when rain pelteth 
Then let winged Fancy wander 
Through the thought still spread beyond her 
Open wide the mind's cage door 
She'll dart forth and cloudward soar 
O sweet Fancy let her loose 
Summer's joys are spoilt by use 
And the enjoying of the Spring 
Fades as does its blossoming 
Autumn's red lipp'd fruitage too 
Blushing through the mist and dew 
Cloys with tasting What do then 
Sit thee by the ingle when 
The sear faggot blazes bright 
Spirit of a winter's night 
When the soundless earth is muffled 
And the caked snow is shuffled 
From the ploughboy's heavy shoon 
When the Night doth meet the Noon 
In a dark conspiracy 
To banish Even from her sky 
Sit thee there and send abroad 
With a mind self overaw'd 
Fancy high commission'd send her 
She has vassals to attend her 
She will bring in spite of frost 
Beauties that the earth hath lost 
She will bring thee all together 
All delights of summer weather 
All the buds and bells of May 
From dewy sward or thorny spray 
All the heaped Autumn's wealth 
With a still mysterious stealth 
She will mix these pleasures up 
Like three fit wines in a cup 
And thou shalt quaff it thou shalt hear 
Distant harvest carols clear 
Rustle of the reaped corn 
Sweet birds antheming the morn 
And in the same moment hark 
'Tis the early April lark 
Or the rooks with busy caw 
Foraging for sticks and straw 
Thou shalt at one glance behold 
The daisy and the marigold 
White plum'd lilies and the first 
Hedge grown primrose that hath burst 
Shaded hyacinth alway 
Sapphire queen of the mid May 
And every leaf and every flower 
Pearled with the self same shower 
Thou shalt see the field mouse peep 
Meagre from its celled sleep 
And the snake all winter thin 
Cast on sunny bank its skin 
Freckled nest eggs thou shalt see 
Hatching in the hawthorn tree 
When the hen bird's wing doth rest 
Quiet on her mossy nest 
Then the hurry and alarm 
When the bee hive casts its swarm 
Acorns ripe down pattering 
While the autumn breezes sing 
Oh sweet Fancy let her loose 
Every thing is spoilt by use 
Where's the cheek that doth not fade 
Too much gaz'd at Where's the maid 
Whose lip mature is ever new 
Where's the eye however blue 
Doth not weary Where's the face 
One would meet in every place 
Where's the voice however soft 
One would hear so very oft 
At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth 
Like to bubbles when rain pelteth 
Let then winged Fancy find 
Thee a mistress to thy mind 
Dulcet eyed as Ceres' daughter 
Ere the God of Torment taught her 
How to frown and how to chide 
With a waist and with a side 
White as Hebe's when her zone 
Slipt its golden clasp and down 
Fell her kirtle to her feet 
While she held the goblet sweet 
And Jove grew languid Break the mesh 
Of the Fancy's silken leash 
Quickly break her prison string 
And such joys as these she'll bring 
Let the winged Fancy roam 
Pleasure never is at home 
Bards of Passion and of Mirth 
Ye have left your souls on earth 
Have ye souls in heaven too 
Double lived in regions new 
Yes and those of heaven commune 
With the spheres of sun and moon 
With the noise of fountains wond'rous 
And the parle of voices thund'rous 
With the whisper of heaven's trees 
And one another in soft ease 
Seated on Elysian lawns 
Brows'd by none but Dian's fawns 
Underneath large blue bells tented 
Where the daisies are rose scented 
And the rose herself has got 
Perfume which on earth is not 
Where the nightingale doth sing 
Not a senseless tranced thing 
But divine melodious truth 
Philosophic numbers smooth 
Tales and golden histories 
Of heaven and its mysteries 
Thus ye live on high and then 
On the earth ye live again 
And the souls ye left behind you 
Teach us here the way to find you 
Where your other souls are joying 
Never slumber'd never cloying 
Here your earth born souls still speak 
To mortals of their little week 
Of their sorrows and delights 
Of their passions and their spites 
Of their glory and their shame 
What doth strengthen and what maim 
Thus ye teach us every day 
Wisdom though fled far away 
Bards of Passion and of Mirth 
Ye have left your souls on earth 
Ye have souls in heaven too 
Double lived in regions new 
Souls of Poets dead and gone 
What Elysium have ye known 
Happy field or mossy cavern 
Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern 
Have ye tippled drink more fine 
Than mine host's Canary wine 
Or are fruits of Paradise 
Sweeter than those dainty pies 
Of venison O generous food 
Drest as though bold Robin Hood 
Would with his maid Marian 
Sup and bowse from horn and can 
I have heard that on a day 
Mine host's sign board flew away 
Nobody knew whither till 
An astrologer's old quill 
To a sheepskin gave the story 
Said he saw you in your glory 
Underneath a new old sign 
Sipping beverage divine 
And pledging with contented smack 
The Mermaid in the Zodiac 
Souls of Poets dead and gone 
What Elysium have ye known 
Happy field or mossy cavern 
Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern 
No those days are gone away 
And their hours are old and gray 
And their minutes buried all 
Under the down trodden pall 
Of the leaves of many years 
Many times have winter's shears 
Frozen North and chilling East 
Sounded tempests to the feast 
Of the forest's whispering fleeces 
Since men knew nor rent nor leases 
No the bugle sounds no more 
And the twanging bow no more 
Silent is the ivory shrill 
Past the heath and up the hill 
There is no mid forest laugh 
Where lone Echo gives the half 
To some wight amaz'd to hear 
Jesting deep in forest drear 
On the fairest time of June 
You may go with sun or moon 
Or the seven stars to light you 
Or the polar ray to right you 
But you never may behold 
Little John or Robin bold 
Never one of all the clan 
Thrumming on an empty can 
Some old hunting ditty while 
He doth his green way beguile 
To fair hostess Merriment 
Down beside the pasture Trent 
For he left the merry tale 
Messenger for spicy ale 
Gone the merry morris din 
Gone the song of Gamelyn 
Gone the tough belted outlaw 
Idling in the grenè shawe 
All are gone away and past 
And if Robin should be cast 
Sudden from his turfed grave 
And if Marian should have 
Once again her forest days 
She would weep and he would craze 
He would swear for all his oaks 
Fall'n beneath the dockyard strokes 
Have rotted on the briny seas 
She would weep that her wild bees 
Sang not to her strange that honey 
Can't be got without hard money 
So it is yet let us sing 
Honour to the old bow string 
Honour to the bugle horn 
Honour to the woods unshorn 
Honour to the Lincoln green 
Honour to the archer keen 
Honour to tight little John 
And the horse he rode upon 
Honour to bold Robin Hood 
Sleeping in the underwood 
Honour to maid Marian 
And to all the Sherwood clan 
Though their days have hurried by 
Let us two a burden try 
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness 
Close bosom friend of the maturing sun 
Conspiring with him how to load and bless 
With fruit the vines that round the thatch eves run 
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage trees 
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core 
To swell the gourd and plump the hazel shells 
With a sweet kernel to set budding more 
And still more later flowers for the bees 
Until they think warm days will never cease 
For Summer has o'er brimm'd their clammy cells 
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store 
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find 
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor 
Thy hair soft lifted by the winnowing wind 
Or on a half reap'd furrow sound asleep 
Drows'd with the fume of poppies while thy hook 
Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers 
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep 
Steady thy laden head across a brook 
Or by a cyder press with patient look 
Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours 
Where are the songs of Spring Ay where are they 
Think not of them thou hast thy music too 
While barred clouds bloom the soft dying day 
And touch the stubble plains with rosy hue 
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn 
Among the river sallows borne aloft 
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies 
And full grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn 
Hedge crickets sing and now with treble soft 
The red breast whistles from a garden croft 
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies 
No no go not to Lethe neither twist 
Wolf's bane tight rooted for its poisonous wine 
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd 
By nightshade ruby grape of Proserpine 
Make not your rosary of yew berries 
Nor let the beetle nor the death moth be 
Your mournful Psyche nor the downy owl 
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries 
For shade to shade will come too drowsily 
And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul 
But when the melancholy fit shall fall 
Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud 
That fosters the droop headed flowers all 
And hides the green hill in an April shroud 
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose 
Or on the rainbow of the salt sand wave 
Or on the wealth of globed peonies 
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows 
Emprison her soft hand and let her rave 
And feed deep deep upon her peerless eyes 
She dwells with Beauty Beauty that must die 
And Joy whose hand is ever at his lips 
Bidding adieu and aching Pleasure nigh 
Turning to poison while the bee mouth sips 
Ay in the very temple of Delight 
Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine 
Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue 
Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine 
His soul shall taste the sadness of her might 
And be among her cloudy trophies hung 
Deep in the shady sadness of a vale 
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn 
Far from the fiery noon and eve's one star 
Sat gray hair'd Saturn quiet as a stone 
Still as the silence round about his lair 
Forest on forest hung about his head 
Like cloud on cloud No stir of air was there 
Not so much life as on a summer's day 
Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass 
But where the dead leaf fell there did it rest 
A stream went voiceless by still deadened more 
By reason of his fallen divinity 
Spreading a shade the Naiad 'mid her reeds 
Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips 
Along the margin sand large foot marks went 
No further than to where his feet had stray'd 
And slept there since Upon the sodden ground 
His old right hand lay nerveless listless dead 
Unsceptred and his realmless eyes were closed 
While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth 
His ancient mother for some comfort yet 
It seem'd no force could wake him from his place 
But there came one who with a kindred hand 
Touch'd his wide shoulders after bending low 
With reverence though to one who knew it not 
She was a Goddess of the infant world 
By her in stature the tall Amazon 
Had stood a pigmy's height she would have ta'en 
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck 
Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel 
Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx 
Pedestal'd haply in a palace court 
When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore 
But oh how unlike marble was that face 
How beautiful if sorrow had not made 
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self 
There was a listening fear in her regard 
As if calamity had but begun 
As if the vanward clouds of evil days 
Had spent their malice and the sullen rear 
Was with its stored thunder labouring up 
One hand she press'd upon that aching spot 
Where beats the human heart as if just there 
Though an immortal she felt cruel pain 
The other upon Saturn's bended neck 
She laid and to the level of his ear 
Leaning with parted lips some words she spake 
In solemn tenour and deep organ tone 
Some mourning words which in our feeble tongue 
Would come in these like accents O how frail 
To that large utterance of the early Gods 
Saturn look up though wherefore poor old King 
I have no comfort for thee no not one 
I cannot say 'O wherefore sleepest thou ' 
For heaven is parted from thee and the earth 
Knows thee not thus afflicted for a God 
And ocean too with all its solemn noise 
Has from thy sceptre pass'd and all the air 
Is emptied of thine hoary majesty 
Thy thunder conscious of the new command 
Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house 
And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands 
Scorches and burns our once serene domain 
O aching time O moments big as years 
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth 
And press it so upon our weary griefs 
That unbelief has not a space to breathe 
Saturn sleep on O thoughtless why did I 
Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude 
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes 
Saturn sleep on while at thy feet I weep 
As when upon a tranced summer night 
Those green rob'd senators of mighty woods 
Tall oaks branch charmed by the earnest stars 
Dream and so dream all night without a stir 
Save from one gradual solitary gust 
Which comes upon the silence and dies off 
As if the ebbing air had but one wave 
So came these words and went the while in tears 
She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground 
Just where her falling hair might be outspread 
A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet 
One moon with alteration slow had shed 
Her silver seasons four upon the night 
And still these two were postured motionless 
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern 
The frozen God still couchant on the earth 
And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet 
Until at length old Saturn lifted up 
His faded eyes and saw his kingdom gone 
And all the gloom and sorrow of the place 
And that fair kneeling Goddess and then spake 
As with a palsied tongue and while his beard 
Shook horrid with such aspen malady 
O tender spouse of gold Hyperion 
Thea I feel thee ere I see thy face 
Look up and let me see our doom in it 
Look up and tell me if this feeble shape 
Is Saturn's tell me if thou hear'st the voice 
Of Saturn tell me if this wrinkling brow 
Naked and bare of its great diadem 
Peers like the front of Saturn Who had power 
To make me desolate whence came the strength 
How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth 
While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp 
But it is so and I am smother'd up 
And buried from all godlike exercise 
Of influence benign on planets pale 
Of admonitions to the winds and seas 
Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting 
And all those acts which Deity supreme 
Doth ease its heart of love in I am gone 
Away from my own bosom I have left 
My strong identity my real self 
Somewhere between the throne and where I sit 
Here on this spot of earth Search Thea search 
Open thine eyes eterne and sphere them round 
Upon all space space starr'd and lorn of light 
Space region'd with life air and barren void 
Spaces of fire and all the yawn of hell 
Search Thea search and tell me if thou seest 
A certain shape or shadow making way 
With wings or chariot fierce to repossess 
A heaven he lost erewhile it must it must 
Be of ripe progress Saturn must be King 
Yes there must be a golden victory 
There must be Gods thrown down and trumpets blown 
Of triumph calm and hymns of festival 
Upon the gold clouds metropolitan 
Voices of soft proclaim and silver stir 
Of strings in hollow shells and there shall be 
Beautiful things made new for the surprise 
Of the sky children I will give command 
Thea Thea Thea where is Saturn 
This passion lifted him upon his feet 
And made his hands to struggle in the air 
His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat 
His eyes to fever out his voice to cease 
He stood and heard not Thea's sobbing deep 
A little time and then again he snatch'd 
Utterance thus But cannot I create 
Cannot I form Cannot I fashion forth 
Another world another universe 
To overbear and crumble this to nought 
Where is another chaos Where That word 
Found way unto Olympus and made quake 
The rebel three Thea was startled up 
And in her bearing was a sort of hope 
As thus she quick voic'd spake yet full of awe 
This cheers our fallen house come to our friends 
O Saturn come away and give them heart 
I know the covert for thence came I hither 
Thus brief then with beseeching eyes she went 
With backward footing through the shade a space 
He follow'd and she turn'd to lead the way 
Through aged boughs that yielded like the mist 
Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest 
Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed 
More sorrow like to this and such like woe 
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe 
The Titans fierce self hid or prison bound 
Groan'd for the old allegiance once more 
And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice 
But one of the whole mammoth brood still kept 
His sov'reignty and rule and majesty 
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire 
Still sat still snuff'd the incense teeming up 
From man to the sun's God yet unsecure 
For as among us mortals omens drear 
Fright and perplex so also shuddered he 
Not at dog's howl or gloom bird's hated screech 
Or the familiar visiting of one 
Upon the first toll of his passing bell 
Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp 
But horrors portion'd to a giant nerve 
Oft made Hyperion ache His palace bright 
Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold 
And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks 
Glar'd a blood red through all its thousand courts 
Arches and domes and fiery galleries 
And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds 
Flush'd angerly while sometimes eagle's wings 
Unseen before by Gods or wondering men 
Darken'd the place and neighing steeds were heard 
Not heard before by Gods or wondering men 
Also when he would taste the spicy wreaths 
Of incense breath'd aloft from sacred hills 
Instead of sweets his ample palate took 
Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick 
And so when harbour'd in the sleepy west 
After the full completion of fair day 
For rest divine upon exalted couch 
And slumber in the arms of melody 
He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease 
With stride colossal on from hall to hall 
While far within each aisle and deep recess 
His winged minions in close clusters stood 
Amaz'd and full of fear like anxious men 
Who on wide plains gather in panting troops 
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers 
Even now while Saturn rous'd from icy trance 
Went step for step with Thea through the woods 
Hyperion leaving twilight in the rear 
Came slope upon the threshold of the west 
Then as was wont his palace door flew ope 
In smoothest silence save what solemn tubes 
Blown by the serious Zephyrs gave of sweet 
And wandering sounds slow breathed melodies 
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape 
In fragrance soft and coolness to the eye 
That inlet to severe magnificence 
Stood full blown for the God to enter in 
He enter'd but he enter'd full of wrath 
His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels 
And gave a roar as if of earthly fire 
That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours 
And made their dove wings tremble On he flared 
From stately nave to nave from vault to vault 
Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light 
And diamond paved lustrous long arcades 
Until he reach'd the great main cupola 
There standing fierce beneath he stampt his foot 
And from the basements deep to the high towers 
Jarr'd his own golden region and before 
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd 
His voice leapt out despite of godlike curb 
To this result O dreams of day and night 
O monstrous forms O effigies of pain 
O spectres busy in a cold cold gloom 
O lank eared Phantoms of black weeded pools 
Why do I know ye why have I seen ye why 
Is my eternal essence thus distraught 
To see and to behold these horrors new 
Saturn is fallen am I too to fall 
Am I to leave this haven of my rest 
This cradle of my glory this soft clime 
This calm luxuriance of blissful light 
These crystalline pavilions and pure fanes 
Of all my lucent empire It is left 
Deserted void nor any haunt of mine 
The blaze the splendor and the symmetry 
I cannot see but darkness death and darkness 
Even here into my centre of repose 
The shady visions come to domineer 
Insult and blind and stifle up my pomp 
Fall No by Tellus and her briny robes 
Over the fiery frontier of my realms 
I will advance a terrible right arm 
Shall scare that infant thunderer rebel Jove 
And bid old Saturn take his throne again 
He spake and ceas'd the while a heavier threat 
Held struggle with his throat but came not forth 
For as in theatres of crowded men 
Hubbub increases more they call out Hush 
So at Hyperion's words the Phantoms pale 
Bestirr'd themselves thrice horrible and cold 
And from the mirror'd level where he stood 
A mist arose as from a scummy marsh 
At this through all his bulk an agony 
Crept gradual from the feet unto the crown 
Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular 
Making slow way with head and neck convuls'd 
From over strained might Releas'd he fled 
To the eastern gates and full six dewy hours 
Before the dawn in season due should blush 
He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals 
Clear'd them of heavy vapours burst them wide 
Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams 
The planet orb of fire whereon he rode 
Each day from east to west the heavens through 
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds 
Not therefore veiled quite blindfold and hid 
But ever and anon the glancing spheres 
Circles and arcs and broad belting colure 
Glow'd through and wrought upon the muffling dark 
Sweet shaped lightnings from the nadir deep 
Up to the zenith hieroglyphics old 
Which sages and keen eyed astrologers 
Then living on the earth with labouring thought 
Won from the gaze of many centuries 
Now lost save what we find on remnants huge 
Of stone or marble swart their import gone 
Their wisdom long since fled Two wings this orb 
Possess'd for glory two fair argent wings 
Ever exalted at the God's approach 
And now from forth the gloom their plumes immense 
Rose one by one till all outspreaded were 
While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse 
Awaiting for Hyperion's command 
Fain would he have commanded fain took throne 
And bid the day begin if but for change 
He might not No though a primeval God 
The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd 
Therefore the operations of the dawn 
Stay'd in their birth even as here 'tis told 
Those silver wings expanded sisterly 
Eager to sail their orb the porches wide 
Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night 
And the bright Titan phrenzied with new woes 
Unus'd to bend by hard compulsion bent 
His spirit to the sorrow of the time 
And all along a dismal rack of clouds 
Upon the boundaries of day and night 
He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint 
There as he lay the Heaven with its stars 
Look'd down on him with pity and the voice 
Of Coelus from the universal space 
Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear 
O brightest of my children dear earth born 
And sky engendered Son of Mysteries 
All unrevealed even to the powers 
Which met at thy creating at whose joys 
And palpitations sweet and pleasures soft 
I Coelus wonder how they came and whence 
And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be 
Distinct and visible symbols divine 
Manifestations of that beauteous life 
Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space 
Of these new form'd art thou oh brightest child 
Of these thy brethren and the Goddesses 
There is sad feud among ye and rebellion 
Of son against his sire I saw him fall 
I saw my first born tumbled from his throne 
To me his arms were spread to me his voice 
Found way from forth the thunders round his head 
Pale wox I and in vapours hid my face 
Art thou too near such doom vague fear there is 
For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods 
Divine ye were created and divine 
In sad demeanour solemn undisturb'd 
Unruffled like high Gods ye liv'd and ruled 
Now I behold in you fear hope and wrath 
Actions of rage and passion even as 
I see them on the mortal world beneath 
In men who die This is the grief O Son 
Sad sign of ruin sudden dismay and fall 
Yet do thou strive as thou art capable 
As thou canst move about an evident God 
And canst oppose to each malignant hour 
Ethereal presence I am but a voice 
My life is but the life of winds and tides 
No more than winds and tides can I avail 
But thou canst Be thou therefore in the van 
Of circumstance yea seize the arrow's barb 
Before the tense string murmur To the earth 
For there thou wilt find Saturn and his woes 
Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun 
And of thy seasons be a careful nurse 
Ere half this region whisper had come down 
Hyperion arose and on the stars 
Lifted his curved lids and kept them wide 
Until it ceas'd and still he kept them wide 
And still they were the same bright patient stars 
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast 
Like to a diver in the pearly seas 
Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore 
And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night 
BOOK II 
Just at the self same beat of Time's wide wings 
Hyperion slid into the rustled air 
And Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place 
Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd 
It was a den where no insulting light 
Could glimmer on their tears where their own groans 
They felt but heard not for the solid roar 
Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse 
Pouring a constant bulk uncertain where 
Crag jutting forth to crag and rocks that seem'd 
Ever as if just rising from a sleep 
Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns 
And thus in thousand hugest phantasies 
Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe 
Instead of thrones hard flint they sat upon 
Couches of rugged stone and slaty ridge 
Stubborn'd with iron All were not assembled 
Some chain'd in torture and some wandering 
Coeus and Gyges and Briareüs 
Typhon and Dolor and Porphyrion 
With many more the brawniest in assault 
Were pent in regions of laborious breath 
Dungeon'd in opaque element to keep 
Their clenched teeth still clench'd and all their limbs 
Lock'd up like veins of metal crampt and screw'd 
Without a motion save of their big hearts 
Heaving in pain and horribly convuls'd 
With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse 
Mnemosyne was straying in the world 
Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered 
And many else were free to roam abroad 
But for the main here found they covert drear 
Scarce images of life one here one there 
Lay vast and edgeways like a dismal cirque 
Of Druid stones upon a forlorn moor 
When the chill rain begins at shut of eve 
In dull November and their chancel vault 
The Heaven itself is blinded throughout night 
Each one kept shroud nor to his neighbour gave 
Or word or look or action of despair 
Creüs was one his ponderous iron mace 
Lay by him and a shatter'd rib of rock 
Told of his rage ere he thus sank and pined 
Iäpetus another in his grasp 
A serpent's plashy neck its barbed tongue 
Squeez'd from the gorge and all its uncurl'd length 
Dead and because the creature could not spit 
Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove 
Next Cottus prone he lay chin uppermost 
As though in pain for still upon the flint 
He ground severe his skull with open mouth 
And eyes at horrid working Nearest him 
Asia born of most enormous Caf 
Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs 
Though feminine than any of her sons 
More thought than woe was in her dusky face 
For she was prophesying of her glory 
And in her wide imagination stood 
Palm shaded temples and high rival fanes 
By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles 
Even as Hope upon her anchor leans 
So leant she not so fair upon a tusk 
Shed from the broadest of her elephants 
Above her on a crag's uneasy shelve 
Upon his elbow rais'd all prostrate else 
Shadow'd Enceladus once tame and mild 
As grazing ox unworried in the meads 
Now tiger passion'd lion thoughted wroth 
He meditated plotted and even now 
Was hurling mountains in that second war 
Not long delay'd that scar'd the younger Gods 
To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird 
Not far hence Atlas and beside him prone 
Phorcus the sire of Gorgons Neighbour'd close 
Oceanus and Tethys in whose lap 
Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair 
In midst of all lay Themis at the feet 
Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight 
No shape distinguishable more than when 
Thick night confounds the pine tops with the clouds 
And many else whose names may not be told 
For when the Muse's wings are air ward spread 
Who shall delay her flight And she must chaunt 
Of Saturn and his guide who now had climb'd 
With damp and slippery footing from a depth 
More horrid still Above a sombre cliff 
Their heads appear'd and up their stature grew 
Till on the level height their steps found ease 
Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms 
Upon the precincts of this nest of pain 
And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face 
There saw she direst strife the supreme God 
At war with all the frailty of grief 
Of rage of fear anxiety revenge 
Remorse spleen hope but most of all despair 
Against these plagues he strove in vain for Fate 
Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head 
A disanointing poison so that Thea 
Affrighted kept her still and let him pass 
First onwards in among the fallen tribe 
As with us mortal men the laden heart 
Is persecuted more and fever'd more 
When it is nighing to the mournful house 
Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise 
So Saturn as he walk'd into the midst 
Felt faint and would have sunk among the rest 
But that he met Enceladus's eye 
Whose mightiness and awe of him at once 
Came like an inspiration and he shouted 
Titans behold your God at which some groan'd 
Some started on their feet some also shouted 
Some wept some wail'd all bow'd with reverence 
And Ops uplifting her black folded veil 
Show'd her pale cheeks and all her forehead wan 
Her eye brows thin and jet and hollow eyes 
There is a roaring in the bleak grown pines 
When Winter lifts his voice there is a noise 
Among immortals when a God gives sign 
With hushing finger how he means to load 
His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought 
With thunder and with music and with pomp 
Such noise is like the roar of bleak grown pines 
Which when it ceases in this mountain'd world 
No other sound succeeds but ceasing here 
Among these fallen Saturn's voice therefrom 
Grew up like organ that begins anew 
Its strain when other harmonies stopt short 
Leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly 
Thus grew it up Not in my own sad breast 
Which is its own great judge and searcher out 
Can I find reason why ye should be thus 
Not in the legends of the first of days 
Studied from that old spirit leaved book 
Which starry Uranus with finger bright 
Sav'd from the shores of darkness when the waves 
Low ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom 
And the which book ye know I ever kept 
For my firm based footstool Ah infirm 
Not there nor in sign symbol or portent 
Of element earth water air and fire 
At war at peace or inter quarreling 
One against one or two or three or all 
Each several one against the other three 
As fire with air loud warring when rain floods 
Drown both and press them both against earth's face 
Where finding sulphur a quadruple wrath 
Unhinges the poor world not in that strife 
Wherefrom I take strange lore and read it deep 
Can I find reason why ye should be thus 
No no where can unriddle though I search 
And pore on Nature's universal scroll 
Even to swooning why ye Divinities 
The first born of all shap'd and palpable Gods 
Should cower beneath what in comparison 
Is untremendous might Yet ye are here 
O'erwhelm'd and spurn'd and batter'd ye are here 
O Titans shall I say 'Arise ' Ye groan 
Shall I say 'Crouch ' Ye groan What can I then 
O Heaven wide O unseen parent dear 
What can I Tell me all ye brethren Gods 
How we can war how engine our great wrath 
O speak your counsel now for Saturn's ear 
Is all a hunger'd Thou Oceanus 
Ponderest high and deep and in thy face 
I see astonied that severe content 
Which comes of thought and musing give us help 
So ended Saturn and the God of the Sea 
Sophist and sage from no Athenian grove 
But cogitation in his watery shades 
Arose with locks not oozy and began 
In murmurs which his first endeavouring tongue 
Caught infant like from the far foamed sands 
O ye whom wrath consumes who passion stung 
Writhe at defeat and nurse your agonies 
Shut up your senses stifle up your ears 
My voice is not a bellows unto ire 
Yet listen ye who will whilst I bring proof 
How ye perforce must be content to stoop 
And in the proof much comfort will I give 
If ye will take that comfort in its truth 
We fall by course of Nature's law not force 
Of thunder or of Jove Great Saturn thou 
Hast sifted well the atom universe 
But for this reason that thou art the King 
And only blind from sheer supremacy 
One avenue was shaded from thine eyes 
Through which I wandered to eternal truth 
And first as thou wast not the first of powers 
So art thou not the last it cannot be 
Thou art not the beginning nor the end 
From chaos and parental darkness came 
Light the first fruits of that intestine broil 
That sullen ferment which for wondrous ends 
Was ripening in itself The ripe hour came 
And with it light and light engendering 
Upon its own producer forthwith touch'd 
The whole enormous matter into life 
Upon that very hour our parentage 
The Heavens and the Earth were manifest 
Then thou first born and we the giant race 
Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms 
Now comes the pain of truth to whom 'tis pain 
O folly for to bear all naked truths 
And to envisage circumstance all calm 
That is the top of sovereignty Mark well 
As Heaven and Earth are fairer fairer far 
Than Chaos and blank Darkness though once chiefs 
And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth 
In form and shape compact and beautiful 
In will in action free companionship 
And thousand other signs of purer life 
So on our heels a fresh perfection treads 
A power more strong in beauty born of us 
And fated to excel us as we pass 
In glory that old Darkness nor are we 
Thereby more conquer'd than by us the rule 
Of shapeless Chaos Say doth the dull soil 
Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed 
And feedeth still more comely than itself 
Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves 
Or shall the tree be envious of the dove 
Because it cooeth and hath snowy wings 
To wander wherewithal and find its joys 
We are such forest trees and our fair boughs 
Have bred forth not pale solitary doves 
But eagles golden feather'd who do tower 
Above us in their beauty and must reign 
In right thereof for 'tis the eternal law 
That first in beauty should be first in might 
Yea by that law another race may drive 
Our conquerors to mourn as we do now 
Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas 
My dispossessor Have ye seen his face 
Have ye beheld his chariot foam'd along 
By noble winged creatures he hath made 
I saw him on the calmed waters scud 
With such a glow of beauty in his eyes 
That it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell 
To all my empire farewell sad I took 
And hither came to see how dolorous fate 
Had wrought upon ye and how I might best 
Give consolation in this woe extreme 
Receive the truth and let it be your balm 
Whether through poz'd conviction or disdain 
They guarded silence when Oceanus 
Left murmuring what deepest thought can tell 
But so it was none answer'd for a space 
Save one whom none regarded Clymene 
And yet she answer'd not only complain'd 
With hectic lips and eyes up looking mild 
Thus wording timidly among the fierce 
O Father I am here the simplest voice 
And all my knowledge is that joy is gone 
And this thing woe crept in among our hearts 
There to remain for ever as I fear 
I would not bode of evil if I thought 
So weak a creature could turn off the help 
Which by just right should come of mighty Gods 
Yet let me tell my sorrow let me tell 
Of what I heard and how it made me weep 
And know that we had parted from all hope 
I stood upon a shore a pleasant shore 
Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land 
Of fragrance quietness and trees and flowers 
Full of calm joy it was as I of grief 
Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth 
So that I felt a movement in my heart 
To chide and to reproach that solitude 
With songs of misery music of our woes 
And sat me down and took a mouthed shell 
And murmur'd into it and made melody 
O melody no more for while I sang 
And with poor skill let pass into the breeze 
The dull shell's echo from a bowery strand 
Just opposite an island of the sea 
There came enchantment with the shifting wind 
That did both drown and keep alive my ears 
I threw my shell away upon the sand 
And a wave fill'd it as my sense was fill'd 
With that new blissful golden melody 
A living death was in each gush of sounds 
Each family of rapturous hurried notes 
That fell one after one yet all at once 
Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string 
And then another then another strain 
Each like a dove leaving its olive perch 
With music wing'd instead of silent plumes 
To hover round my head and make me sick 
Of joy and grief at once Grief overcame 
And I was stopping up my frantic ears 
When past all hindrance of my trembling hands 
A voice came sweeter sweeter than all tune 
And still it cried 'Apollo young Apollo 
The morning bright Apollo young Apollo ' 
I fled it follow'd me and cried 'Apollo ' 
O Father and O Brethren had ye felt 
Those pains of mine O Saturn hadst thou felt 
Ye would not call this too indulged tongue 
Presumptuous in thus venturing to be heard 
So far her voice flow'd on like timorous brook 
That lingering along a pebbled coast 
Doth fear to meet the sea but sea it met 
And shudder'd for the overwhelming voice 
Of huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath 
The ponderous syllables like sullen waves 
In the half glutted hollows of reef rocks 
Came booming thus while still upon his arm 
He lean'd not rising from supreme contempt 
Or shall we listen to the over wise 
Or to the over foolish Giant Gods 
Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt till all 
That rebel Jove's whole armoury were spent 
Not world on world upon these shoulders piled 
Could agonize me more than baby words 
In midst of this dethronement horrible 
Speak roar shout yell ye sleepy Titans all 
Do ye forget the blows the buffets vile 
Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm 
Dost thou forget sham Monarch of the Waves 
Thy scalding in the seas What have I rous'd 
Your spleens with so few simple words as these 
O joy for now I see ye are not lost 
O joy for now I see a thousand eyes 
Wide glaring for revenge As this he said 
He lifted up his stature vast and stood 
Still without intermission speaking thus 
Now ye are flames I'll tell you how to burn 
And purge the ether of our enemies 
How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire 
And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove 
Stifling that puny essence in its tent 
O let him feel the evil he hath done 
For though I scorn Oceanus's lore 
Much pain have I for more than loss of realms 
The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled 
Those days all innocent of scathing war 
When all the fair Existences of heaven 
Came open eyed to guess what we would speak 
That was before our brows were taught to frown 
Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds 
That was before we knew the winged thing 
Victory might be lost or might be won 
And be ye mindful that Hyperion 
Our brightest brother still is undisgraced 
Hyperion lo his radiance is here 
All eyes were on Enceladus's face 
And they beheld while still Hyperion's name 
Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks 
A pallid gleam across his features stern 
Not savage for he saw full many a God 
Wroth as himself He look'd upon them all 
And in each face he saw a gleam of light 
But splendider in Saturn's whose hoar locks 
Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel 
When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove 
In pale and silver silence they remain'd 
Till suddenly a splendour like the morn 
Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps 
All the sad spaces of oblivion 
And every gulf and every chasm old 
And every height and every sullen depth 
Voiceless or hoarse with loud tormented streams 
And all the everlasting cataracts 
And all the headlong torrents far and near 
Mantled before in darkness and huge shade 
Now saw the light and made it terrible 
It was Hyperion a granite peak 
His bright feet touch'd and there he stay'd to view 
The misery his brilliance had betray'd 
To the most hateful seeing of itself 
Golden his hair of short Numidian curl 
Regal his shape majestic a vast shade 
In midst of his own brightness like the bulk 
Of Memnon's image at the set of sun 
To one who travels from the dusking East 
Sighs too as mournful as that Memnon's harp 
He utter'd while his hands contemplative 
He press'd together and in silence stood 
Despondence seiz'd again the fallen Gods 
At sight of the dejected King of Day 
And many hid their faces from the light 
But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes 
Among the brotherhood and at their glare 
Uprose Iäpetus and Creüs too 
And Phorcus sea born and together strode 
To where he towered on his eminence 
There those four shouted forth old Saturn's name 
Hyperion from the peak loud answered Saturn 
Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods 
In whose face was no joy though all the Gods 
Gave from their hollow throats the name of Saturn 
BOOK III 
Thus in alternate uproar and sad peace 
Amazed were those Titans utterly 
O leave them Muse O leave them to their woes 
For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire 
A solitary sorrow best befits 
Thy lips and antheming a lonely grief 
Leave them O Muse for thou anon wilt find 
Many a fallen old Divinity 
Wandering in vain about bewildered shores 
Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp 
And not a wind of heaven but will breathe 
In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute 
For lo 'tis for the Father of all verse 
Flush every thing that hath a vermeil hue 
Let the rose glow intense and warm the air 
And let the clouds of even and of morn 
Float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the hills 
Let the red wine within the goblet boil 
Cold as a bubbling well let faint lipp'd shells 
On sands or in great deeps vermilion turn 
Through all their labyrinths and let the maid 
Blush keenly as with some warm kiss surpris'd 
Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades 
Rejoice O Delos with thine olives green 
And poplars and lawn shading palms and beech 
In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song 
And hazels thick dark stemm'd beneath the shade 
Apollo is once more the golden theme 
Where was he when the Giant of the Sun 
Stood bright amid the sorrow of his peers 
Together had he left his mother fair 
And his twin sister sleeping in their bower 
And in the morning twilight wandered forth 
Beside the osiers of a rivulet 
Full ankle deep in lilies of the vale 
The nightingale had ceas'd and a few stars 
Were lingering in the heavens while the thrush 
Began calm throated Throughout all the isle 
There was no covert no retired cave 
Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves 
Though scarcely heard in many a green recess 
He listen'd and he wept and his bright tears 
Went trickling down the golden bow he held 
Thus with half shut suffused eyes he stood 
While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by 
With solemn step an awful Goddess came 
And there was purport in her looks for him 
Which he with eager guess began to read 
Perplex'd the while melodiously he said 
How cam'st thou over the unfooted sea 
Or hath that antique mien and robed form 
Mov'd in these vales invisible till now 
Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o'er 
The fallen leaves when I have sat alone 
In cool mid forest Surely I have traced 
The rustle of those ample skirts about 
These grassy solitudes and seen the flowers 
Lift up their heads as still the whisper pass'd 
Goddess I have beheld those eyes before 
And their eternal calm and all that face 
Or I have dream'd Yes said the supreme shape 
Thou hast dream'd of me and awaking up 
Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side 
Whose strings touch'd by thy fingers all the vast 
Unwearied ear of the whole universe 
Listen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth 
Of such new tuneful wonder Is't not strange 
That thou shouldst weep so gifted Tell me youth 
What sorrow thou canst feel for I am sad 
When thou dost shed a tear explain thy griefs 
To one who in this lonely isle hath been 
The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life 
From the young day when first thy infant hand 
Pluck'd witless the weak flowers till thine arm 
Could bend that bow heroic to all times 
Show thy heart's secret to an ancient Power 
Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones 
For prophecies of thee and for the sake 
Of loveliness new born Apollo then 
With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes 
Thus answer'd while his white melodious throat 
Throbb'd with the syllables Mnemosyne 
Thy name is on my tongue I know not how 
Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest 
Why should I strive to show what from thy lips 
Would come no mystery For me dark dark 
And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes 
I strive to search wherefore I am so sad 
Until a melancholy numbs my limbs 
And then upon the grass I sit and moan 
Like one who once had wings O why should I 
Feel curs'd and thwarted when the liegeless air 
Yields to my step aspirant why should I 
Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet 
Goddess benign point forth some unknown thing 
Are there not other regions than this isle 
What are the stars There is the sun the sun 
And the most patient brilliance of the moon 
And stars by thousands Point me out the way 
To any one particular beauteous star 
And I will flit into it with my lyre 
And make its silvery splendour pant with bliss 
I have heard the cloudy thunder Where is power 
Whose hand whose essence what divinity 
Makes this alarum in the elements 
While I here idle listen on the shores 
In fearless yet in aching ignorance 
O tell me lonely Goddess by thy harp 
That waileth every morn and eventide 
Tell me why thus I rave about these groves 
Mute thou remainest Mute yet I can read 
A wondrous lesson in thy silent face 
Knowledge enormous makes a God of me 
Names deeds gray legends dire events rebellions 
Majesties sovran voices agonies 
Creations and destroyings all at once 
Pour into the wide hollows of my brain 
And deify me as if some blithe wine 
Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk 
And so become immortal Thus the God 
While his enkindled eyes with level glance 
Beneath his white soft temples stedfast kept 
Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne 
Soon wild commotions shook him and made flush 
All the immortal fairness of his limbs 
Most like the struggle at the gate of death 
Or liker still to one who should take leave 
Of pale immortal death and with a pang 
As hot as death's is chill with fierce convulse 
Die into life so young Apollo anguish'd 
His very hair his golden tresses famed 
Kept undulation round his eager neck 
During the pain Mnemosyne upheld 
Her arms as one who prophesied At length 
Apollo shriek'd and lo from all his limbs 
Celestial 
Glory and loveliness have passed away 
For if we wander out in early morn 
No wreathed incense do we see upborne 
Into the east to meet the smiling day 
No crowd of nymphs soft voic'd and young and gay 
In woven baskets bringing ears of corn 
Roses and pinks and violets to adorn 
The shrine of Flora in her early May 
But there are left delights as high as these 
And I shall ever bless my destiny 
That in a time when under pleasant trees 
Pan is no longer sought I feel a free 
A leafy luxury seeing I could please 
With these poor offerings a man like thee 
I stood tip toe upon a little hill 
The air was cooling and so very still 
That the sweet buds which with a modest pride 
Pull droopingly in slanting curve aside 
Their scantly leaved and finely tapering stems 
Had not yet lost those starry diadems 
Caught from the early sobbing of the morn 
The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn 
And fresh from the clear brook sweetly they slept 
On the blue fields of heaven and then there crept 
A little noiseless noise among the leaves 
Born of the very sigh that silence heaves 
For not the faintest motion could be seen 
Of all the shades that slanted o'er the green 
There was wide wand'ring for the greediest eye 
To peer about upon variety 
Far round the horizon's crystal air to skim 
And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim 
To picture out the quaint and curious bending 
Of a fresh woodland alley never ending 
Or by the bowery clefts and leafy shelves 
Guess were the jaunty streams refresh themselves 
I gazed awhile and felt as light and free 
As though the fanning wings of Mercury 
Had played upon my heels I was light hearted 
And many pleasures to my vision started 
So I straightway began to pluck a posey 
Of luxuries bright milky soft and rosy 
A bush of May flowers with the bees about them 
Ah sure no tasteful nook would be without them 
And let a lush laburnum oversweep them 
And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them 
Moist cool and green and shade the violets 
That they may bind the moss in leafy nets 
A filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined 
And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind 
Upon their summer thrones there too should be 
The frequent chequer of a youngling tree 
That with a score of light green brethen shoots 
From the quaint mossiness of aged roots 
Round which is heard a spring head of clear waters 
Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters 
The spreading blue bells it may haply mourn 
That such fair clusters should be rudely torn 
From their fresh beds and scattered thoughtlessly 
By infant hands left on the path to die 
Open afresh your round of starry folds 
Ye ardent marigolds 
Dry up the moisture from your golden lids 
For great Apollo bids 
That in these days your praises should be sung 
On many harps which he has lately strung 
And when again your dewiness he kisses 
Tell him I have you in my world of blisses 
So haply when I rove in some far vale 
His mighty voice may come upon the gale 
Here are sweet peas on tip toe for a flight 
With wings of gentle flush o'er delicate white 
And taper fulgent catching at all things 
To bind them all about with tiny rings 
Linger awhile upon some bending planks 
That lean against a streamlet's rushy banks 
And watch intently Nature's gentle doings 
They will be found softer than ring dove's cooings 
How silent comes the water round that bend 
Not the minutest whisper does it send 
To the o'erhanging sallows blades of grass 
Slowly across the chequer'd shadows pass 
Why you might read two sonnets ere they reach 
To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach 
A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds 
Where swarms of minnows show their little heads 
Staying their wavy bodies 'gainst the streams 
To taste the luxury of sunny beams 
Temper'd with coolness How they ever wrestle 
With their own sweet delight and ever nestle 
Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand 
If you but scantily hold out the hand 
That very instant not one will remain 
But turn your eye and they are there again 
The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses 
And cool themselves among the em'rald tresses 
The while they cool themselves they freshness give 
And moisture that the bowery green may live 
So keeping up an interchange of favours 
Like good men in the truth of their behaviours 
Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop 
From low hung branches little space they stop 
But sip and twitter and their feathers sleek 
Then off at once as in a wanton freak 
Or perhaps to show their black and golden wings 
Pausing upon their yellow flutterings 
Were I in such a place I sure should pray 
That nought less sweet might call my thoughts away 
Than the soft rustle of a maiden's gown 
Fanning away the dandelion's down 
Than the light music of her nimble toes 
Patting against the sorrel as she goes 
How she would start and blush thus to be caught 
Playing in all her innocence of thought 
O let me lead her gently o'er the brook 
Watch her half smiling lips and downward look 
O let me for one moment touch her wrist 
Let me one moment to her breathing list 
And as she leaves me may she often turn 
Her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne 
What next A tuft of evening primroses 
O'er which the mind may hover till it dozes 
O'er which it well might take a pleasant sleep 
But that 'tis ever startled by the leap 
Of buds into ripe flowers or by the flitting 
Of diverse moths that aye their rest are quitting 
Or by the moon lifting her silver rim 
Above a cloud and with a gradual swim 
Coming into the blue with all her light 
O Maker of sweet poets dear delight 
Of this fair world and all its gentle livers 
Spangler of clouds halo of crystal rivers 
Mingler with leaves and dew and tumbling streams 
Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams 
Lover of loneliness and wandering 
Of upcast eye and tender pondering 
Thee must I praise above all other glories 
That smile us on to tell delightful stories 
For what has made the sage or poet write 
But the fair paradise of Nature's light 
In the calm grandeur of a sober line 
We see the waving of the mountain pine 
And when a tale is beautifully staid 
We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade 
When it is moving on luxurious wings 
The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings 
Fair dewy roses brush against our faces 
And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases 
O'er head we see the jasmine and sweet briar 
And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire 
While at our feet the voice of crystal bubbles 
Charms us at once away from all our troubles 
So that we feel uplifted from the world 
Walking upon the white clouds wreath'd and curl'd 
So felt he who first told how Psyche went 
On the smooth wind to realms of wonderment 
What Psyche felt and Love when their full lips 
First touch'd what amorous and fondling nips 
They gave each other's cheeks with all their sighs 
And how they kist each other's tremulous eyes 
The silver lamp the ravishment the wonder 
The darkness loneliness the fearful thunder 
Their woes gone by and both to heaven upflown 
To bow for gratitude before Jove's throne 
So did he feel who pull'd the boughs aside 
That we might look into a forest wide 
To catch a glimpse of Fawns and Dryades 
Coming with softest rustle through the trees 
And garlands woven of flowers wild and sweet 
Upheld on ivory wrists or sporting feet 
Telling us how fair trembling Syrinx fled 
Arcadian Pan with such a fearful dread 
Poor nymph poor Pan how he did weep to find 
Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind 
Along the reedy stream a half heard strain 
Full of sweet desolation balmy pain 
What first inspired a bard of old to sing 
Narcissus pining o'er the untainted spring 
In some delicious ramble he had found 
A little space with boughs all woven round 
And in the midst of all a clearer pool 
Than e'er reflected in its pleasant cool 
The blue sky here and there serenely peeping 
Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping 
And on the bank a lonely flower he spied 
A meek and forlorn flower with naught of pride 
Drooping its beauty o'er the watery clearness 
To woo its own sad image into nearness 
Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move 
But still would seem to droop to pine to love 
So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot 
Some fainter gleamings o'er his fancy shot 
Nor was it long ere he had told the tale 
Of young Narcissus and sad Echo's bale 
Where had he been from whose warm head out flew 
That sweetest of all songs that ever new 
That aye refreshing pure deliciousness 
Coming ever to bless 
The wanderer by moonlight to him bringing 
Shapes from the invisible world unearthly singing 
From out the middle air from flowery nests 
And from the pillowy silkiness that rests 
Full in the speculation of the stars 
Ah surely he had burst our mortal bars 
Into some wond'rous region he had gone 
To search for thee divine Endymion 
He was a Poet sure a lover too 
Who stood on Latmus' top what time there blew 
Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below 
And brought in faintness solemn sweet and slow 
A hymn from Dian's temple while upswelling 
The incense went to her own starry dwelling 
But though her face was clear as infant's eyes 
Though she stood smiling o'er the sacrifice 
The Poet wept at her so piteous fate 
Wept that such beauty should be desolate 
So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won 
And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion 
Queen of the wide air thou most lovely queen 
Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen 
As thou exceedest all things in thy shine 
So every tale does this sweet tale of thine 
O for three words of honey that I might 
Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night 
Where distant ships do seem to show their keels 
Phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels 
And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes 
Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize 
The evening weather was so bright and clear 
That men of health were of unusual cheer 
Stepping like Homer at the trumpet's call 
Or young Apollo on the pedestal 
And lovely women were as fair and warm 
As Venus looking sideways in alarm 
The breezes were ethereal and pure 
And crept through half closed lattices to cure 
The languid sick it cool'd their fever'd sleep 
And soothed them into slumbers full and deep 
Soon they awoke clear eyed nor burnt with thirsting 
Nor with hot fingers nor with temples bursting 
And springing up they met the wond'ring sight 
Of their dear friends nigh foolish with delight 
Who feel their arms and breasts and kiss and stare 
And on their placid foreheads part the hair 
Young men and maidens at each other gaz'd 
With hands held back and motionless amaz'd 
To see the brightness in each others' eyes 
And so they stood fill'd with a sweet surprise 
Until their tongues were loos'd in poesy 
Therefore no lover did of anguish die 
But the soft numbers in that moment spoken 
Made silken ties that never may be broken 
Cynthia I cannot tell the greater blisses 
That follow'd thine and thy dear shepherd's kisses 
Was there a Poet born but now no more 
My wand'ring spirit must no further soar 
Lo I must tell a tale of chivalry 
For large white plumes are dancing in mine eye 
Not like the formal crest of latter days 
But bending in a thousand graceful ways 
So graceful that it seems no mortal hand 
Or e'en the touch of Archimago's wand 
Could charm them into such an attitude 
We must think rather that in playful mood 
Some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight 
To show this wonder of its gentle might 
Lo I must tell a tale of chivalry 
For while I muse the lance points slantingly 
Athwart the morning air some lady sweet 
Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet 
From the worn top of some old battlement 
Hails it with tears her stout defender sent 
And from her own pure self no joy dissembling 
Wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling 
Sometimes when the good Knight his rest would take 
It is reflected clearly in a lake 
With the young ashen boughs 'gainst which it rests 
And th' half seen mossiness of linnets' nests 
Ah shall I ever tell its cruelty 
When the fire flashes from a warrior's eye 
And his tremendous hand is grasping it 
And his dark brow for very wrath is knit 
Or when his spirit with more calm intent 
Leaps to the honors of a tournament 
And makes the gazers round about the ring 
Stare at the grandeur of the balancing 
No no this is far off then how shall I 
Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy 
Which linger yet about lone gothic arches 
In dark green ivy and among wild larches 
How sing the splendour of the revelries 
When buts of wine are drunk off to the lees 
And that bright lance against the fretted wall 
Beneath the shade of stately banneral 
Is slung with shining cuirass sword and shield 
Where ye may see a spur in bloody field 
Light footed damsels move with gentle paces 
Round the wide hall and show their happy faces 
Or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens 
Like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens 
Yet must I tell a tale of chivalry 
Or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by 
Wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight 
Rein in the swelling of his ample might 
Spenser thy brows are arched open kind 
And come like a clear sun rise to my mind 
And always does my heart with pleasure dance 
When I think on thy noble countenance 
Where never yet was ought more earthly seen 
Than the pure freshness of thy laurels green 
Therefore great bard I not so fearfully 
Call on thy gentle spirit to hover nigh 
My daring steps or if thy tender care 
Thus startled unaware 
Be jealous that the foot of other wight 
Should madly follow that bright path of light 
Trac'd by thy lov'd Libertas he will speak 
And tell thee that my prayer is very meek 
That I will follow with due reverence 
And start with awe at mine own strange pretence 
Him thou wilt hear so I will rest in hope 
To see wide plains fair trees and lawny slope 
The morn the eve the light the shade the flowers 
Clear streams smooth lakes and overlooking towers 
Young Calidore is paddling o'er the lake 
His healthful spirit eager and awake 
To feel the beauty of a silent eve 
Which seem'd full loath this happy world to leave 
The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly 
He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky 
And smiles at the far clearness all around 
Until his heart is well nigh over wound 
And turns for calmness to the pleasant green 
Of easy slopes and shadowy trees that lean 
So elegantly o'er the waters' brim 
And show their blossoms trim 
Scarce can his clear and nimble eye sight follow 
The freaks and dartings of the black wing'd swallow 
Delighting much to see it half at rest 
Dip so refreshingly its wings and breast 
'Gainst the smooth surface and to mark anon 
The widening circles into nothing gone 
And now the sharp keel of his little boat 
Comes up with ripple and with easy float 
And glides into a bed of water lillies 
Broad leav'd are they and their white canopies 
Are upward turn'd to catch the heavens' dew 
Near to a little island's point they grew 
Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view 
Of this sweet spot of earth The bowery shore 
Went off in gentle windings to the hoar 
And light blue mountains but no breathing man 
With a warm heart and eye prepared to scan 
Nature's clear beauty could pass lightly by 
Objects that look'd out so invitingly 
On either side These gentle Calidore 
Greeted as he had known them long before 
The sidelong view of swelling leafiness 
Which the glad setting sun in gold doth dress 
Whence ever and anon the jay outsprings 
And scales upon the beauty of its wings 
The lonely turret shatter'd and outworn 
Stands venerably proud too proud to mourn 
Its long lost grandeur fir trees grow around 
Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground 
The little chapel with the cross above 
Upholding wreaths of ivy the white dove 
That on the windows spreads his feathers light 
And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight 
Green tufted islands casting their soft shades 
Across the lake sequester'd leafy glades 
That through the dimness of their twilight show 
Large dock leaves spiral foxgloves or the glow 
Of the wild cat's eyes or the silvery stems 
Of delicate birch trees or long grass which hems 
A little brook The youth had long been viewing 
These pleasant things and heaven was bedewing 
The mountain flowers when his glad senses caught 
A trumpet's silver voice Ah it was fraught 
With many joys for him the warder's ken 
Had found white coursers prancing in the glen 
Friends very dear to him he soon will see 
So pushes off his boat most eagerly 
And soon upon the lake he skims along 
Deaf to the nightingale's first under song 
Nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly 
His spirit flies before him so completely 
And now he turns a jutting point of land 
Whence may be seen the castle gloomy and grand 
Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches 
Before the point of his light shallop reaches 
Those marble steps that through the water dip 
Now over them he goes with hasty trip 
And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors 
Anon he leaps along the oaken floors 
Of halls and corridors 
Delicious sounds those little bright eyed things 
That float about the air on azure wings 
Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang 
Of clattering hoofs into the court he sprang 
Just as two noble steeds and palfreys twain 
Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein 
While from beneath the threat'ning portcullis 
They brought their happy burthens What a kiss 
What gentle squeeze he gave each lady's hand 
How tremblingly their delicate ancles spann'd 
Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone 
While whisperings of affection 
Made him delay to let their tender feet 
Come to the earth with an incline so sweet 
From their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent 
And whether there were tears of languishment 
Or that the evening dew had pearl'd their tresses 
He feels a moisture on his cheek and blesses 
With lips that tremble and with glistening eye 
All the soft luxury 
That nestled in his arms A dimpled hand 
Fair as some wonder out of fairy land 
Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers 
Of whitest Cassia fresh from summer showers 
And this he fondled with his happy cheek 
As if for joy he would no further seek 
When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond 
Came to his ear like something from beyond 
His present being so he gently drew 
His warm arms thrilling now with pulses new 
From their sweet thrall and forward gently bending 
Thank'd heaven that his joy was never ending 
While 'gainst his forehead he devoutly press'd 
A hand heaven made to succour the distress'd 
A hand that from the world's bleak promontory 
Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory 
Amid the pages and the torches' glare 
There stood a knight patting the flowing hair 
Of his proud horse's mane he was withal 
A man of elegance and stature tall 
So that the waving of his plumes would be 
High as the berries of a wild ash tree 
Or as the winged cap of Mercury 
His armour was so dexterously wrought 
In shape that sure no living man had thought 
It hard and heavy steel but that indeed 
It was some glorious form some splendid weed 
In which a spirit new come from the skies 
Might live and show itself to human eyes 
'Tis the far fam'd the brave Sir Gondibert 
Said the good man to Calidore alert 
While the young warrior with a step of grace 
Came up a courtly smile upon his face 
And mailed hand held out ready to greet 
The large eyed wonder and ambitious heat 
Of the aspiring boy who as he led 
Those smiling ladies often turned his head 
To admire the visor arched so gracefully 
Over a knightly brow while they went by 
The lamps that from the high roof'd hall were pendent 
And gave the steel a shining quite transcendent 
Soon in a pleasant chamber they are seated 
The sweet lipp'd ladies have already greeted 
All the green leaves that round the window clamber 
To show their purple stars and bells of amber 
Sir Gondibert has doff'd his shining steel 
Gladdening in the free and airy feel 
Of a light mantle and while Clerimond 
Is looking round about him with a fond 
And placid eye young Calidore is burning 
To hear of knightly deeds and gallant spurning 
Of all unworthiness and how the strong of arm 
Kept off dismay and terror and alarm 
From lovely woman while brimful of this 
He gave each damsel's hand so warm a kiss 
And had such manly ardour in his eye 
That each at other look'd half staringly 
And then their features started into smiles 
Sweet as blue heavens o'er enchanted isles 
Softly the breezes from the forest came 
Softly they blew aside the taper's flame 
Clear was the song from Philomel's far bower 
Grateful the incense from the lime tree flower 
Mysterious wild the far heard trumpet's tone 
Lovely the moon in ether all alone 
Sweet too the converse of these happy mortals 
As that of busy spirits when the portals 
Are closing in the west or that soft humming 
We hear around when Hesperus is coming 
Sweet be their sleep 
What though while the wonders of nature exploring 
I cannot your light mazy footsteps attend 
Nor listen to accents that almost adoring 
Bless Cynthia's face the enthusiast's friend 
Yet over the steep whence the mountain stream rushes 
With you kindest friends in idea I rove 
Mark the clear tumbling crystal its passionate gushes 
Its spray that the wild flower kindly bedews 
Why linger you so the wild labyrinth strolling 
Why breathless unable your bliss to declare 
Ah you list to the nightingale's tender condoling 
Responsive to sylphs in the moon beamy air 
'Tis morn and the flowers with dew are yet drooping 
I see you are treading the verge of the sea 
And now ah I see it you just now are stooping 
To pick up the keep sake intended for me 
If a cherub on pinions of silver descending 
Had brought me a gem from the fret work of heaven 
And smiles with his star cheering voice sweetly blending 
The blessings of Tighe had melodiously given 
It had not created a warmer emotion 
Than the present fair nymphs I was blest with from you 
Than the shell from the bright golden sands of the ocean 
Which the emerald waves at your feet gladly threw 
For indeed 'tis a sweet and peculiar pleasure 
And blissful is he who such happiness finds 
To possess but a span of the hour of leisure 
In elegant pure and aerial minds 
Hast thou from the caves of Golconda a gem 
Pure as the ice drop that froze on the mountain 
Bright as the humming bird's green diadem 
When it flutters in sun beams that shine through a fountain 
Hast thou a goblet for dark sparkling wine 
That goblet right heavy and massy and gold 
And splendidly mark'd with the story divine 
Of Armida the fair and Rinaldo the bold 
Hast thou a steed with a mane richly flowing 
Hast thou a sword that thine enemy's smart is 
Hast thou a trumpet rich melodies blowing 
And wear'st thou the shield of the fam'd Britomartis 
What is it that hangs from thy shoulder so brave 
Embroidered with many a spring peering flower 
Is it a scarf that thy fair lady gave 
And hastest thou now to that fair lady's bower 
Ah courteous Sir Knight with large joy thou art crown'd 
Full many the glories that brighten thy youth 
I will tell thee my blisses which richly abound 
In magical powers to bless and to sooth 
On this scroll thou seest written in characters fair 
A sun beamy tale of a wreath and a chain 
And warrior it nurtures the property rare 
Of charming my mind from the trammels of pain 
This canopy mark 'tis the work of a fay 
Beneath its rich shade did King Oberon languish 
When lovely Titania was far far away 
And cruelly left him to sorrow and anguish 
There oft would he bring from his soft sighing lute 
Wild strains to which spell bound the nightingales listened 
The wondering spirits of heaven were mute 
And tears 'mong the dewdrops of morning oft glistened 
In this little dome all those melodies strange 
Soft plaintive and melting for ever will sigh 
Nor e'er will the notes from their tenderness change 
Nor e'er will the music of Oberon die 
So when I am in a voluptuous vein 
I pillow my head on the sweets of the rose 
And list to the tale of the wreath and the chain 
Till its echoes depart then I sink to repose 
Adieu valiant Eric with joy thou art crown'd 
Full many the glories that brighten thy youth 
I too have my blisses which richly abound 
In magical powers to bless and to sooth 
Hadst thou liv'd in days of old 
O what wonders had been told 
Of thy lively countenance 
And thy humid eyes that dance 
In the midst of their own brightness 
In the very fane of lightness 
Over which thine eyebrows leaning 
Picture out each lovely meaning 
In a dainty bend they lie 
Like two streaks across the sky 
Or the feathers from a crow 
Fallen on a bed of snow 
Of thy dark hair that extends 
Into many graceful bends 
As the leaves of Hellebore 
Turn to whence they sprung before 
And behind each ample curl 
Peeps the richness of a pearl 
Downward too flows many a tress 
With a glossy waviness 
Full and round like globes that rise 
From the censer to the skies 
Through sunny air Add too the sweetness 
Of thy honied voice the neatness 
Of thine ankle lightly turn'd 
With those beauties scarce discrn'd 
Kept with such sweet privacy 
That they seldom meet the eye 
Of the little loves that fly 
Round about with eager pry 
Saving when with freshening lave 
Thou dipp'st them in the taintless wave 
Like twin water lillies born 
In the coolness of the morn 
O if thou hadst breathed then 
Now the Muses had been ten 
Couldst thou wish for lineage higher 
Than twin sister of Thalia 
At least for ever evermore 
Will I call the Graces four 
Hadst thou liv'd when chivalry 
Lifted up her lance on high 
Tell me what thou wouldst have been 
Ah I see the silver sheen 
Of thy broidered floating vest 
Cov'ring half thine ivory breast 
Which O heavens I should see 
But that cruel destiny 
Has placed a golden cuirass there 
Keeping secret what is fair 
Like sunbeams in a cloudlet nested 
Thy locks in knightly casque are rested 
O'er which bend four milky plumes 
Like the gentle lilly's blooms 
Springing from a costly vase 
See with what a stately pace 
Comes thine alabaster steed 
Servant of heroic deed 
O'er his loins his trappings glow 
Like the northern lights on snow 
Mount his back thy sword unsheath 
Sign of the enchanter's death 
Bane of every wicked spell 
Silencer of dragon's yell 
Alas thou this wilt never do 
Thou art an enchantress too 
And wilt surely never spill 
Blood of those whose eyes can kill 
When by my solitary hearth I sit 
And hateful thoughts enwrap my soul in gloom 
When no fair dreams before my mind's eye flit 
And the bare heath of life presents no bloom 
Sweet Hope ethereal balm upon me shed 
And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head 
Whene'er I wander at the fall of night 
Where woven boughs shut out the moon's bright ray 
Should sad Despondency my musings fright 
And frown to drive fair Cheerfulness away 
Peep with the moon beams through the leafy roof 
And keep that fiend Despondence far aloof 
Should Disappointment parent of Despair 
Strive for her son to seize my careless heart 
When like a cloud he sits upon the air 
Preparing on his spell bound prey to dart 
Chace him away sweet Hope with visage bright 
And fright him as the morning frightens night 
Whene'er the fate of those I hold most dear 
Tells to my fearful breast a tale of sorrow 
O bright eyed Hope my morbid fancy cheer 
Let me awhile thy sweetest comforts borrow 
Thy heaven born radiance around me shed 
And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head 
Should e'er unhappy love my bosom pain 
From cruel parents or relentless fair 
O let me think it is not quite in vain 
To sigh out sonnets to the midnight air 
Sweet Hope ethereal balm upon me shed 
And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head 
In the long vista of the years to roll 
Let me not see our country's honour fade 
O let me see our land retain her soul 
Her pride her freedom and not freedom's shade 
From thy bright eyes unusual brightness shed 
Beneath thy pinions canopy my head 
Let me not see the patriot's high bequest 
Great Liberty how great in plain attire 
With the base purple of a court oppress'd 
Bowing her head and ready to expire 
But let me see thee stoop from heaven on wings 
That fill the skies with silver glitterings 
And as in sparkling majesty a star 
Gilds the bright summit of some gloomy cloud 
Brightening the half veil'd face of heaven afar 
So when dark thoughts my boding spirit shroud 
Sweet Hope celestial influence round me shed 
Waving thy silver pinions o'er my head 
Now Morning from her orient chamber came 
And her first footsteps touch'd a verdant hill 
Crowning its lawny crest with amber flame 
Silv'ring the untainted gushes of its rill 
Which pure from mossy beds did down distill 
And after parting beds of simple flowers 
By many streams a little lake did fill 
Which round its marge reflected woven bowers 
And in its middle space a sky that never lowers 
There the king fisher saw his plumage bright 
Vieing with fish of brilliant dye below 
Whose silken fins and golden scales' light 
Cast upward through the waves a ruby glow 
There saw the swan his neck of arched snow 
And oar'd himself along with majesty 
Sparkled his jetty eyes his feet did show 
Beneath the waves like Afric's ebony 
And on his back a fay reclined voluptuously 
Ah could I tell the wonders of an isle 
That in that fairest lake had placed been 
I could e'en Dido of her grief beguile 
Or rob from aged Lear his bitter teen 
For sure so fair a place was never seen 
Of all that ever charm'd romantic eye 
It seem'd an emerald in the silver sheen 
Of the bright waters or as when on high 
Through clouds of fleecy white laughs the coerulean sky 
And all around it dipp'd luxuriously 
Slopings of verdure through the glossy tide 
Which as it were in gentle amity 
Rippled delighted up the flowery side 
As if to glean the ruddy tears it tried 
Which fell profusely from the rose tree stem 
Haply it was the workings of its pride 
In strife to throw upon the shore a gem 
Outvieing all the buds in Flora's diadem 
Woman when I behold thee flippant vain 
Inconstant childish proud and full of fancies 
Without that modest softening that enhances 
The downcast eye repentant of the pain 
That its mild light creates to heal again 
E'en then elate my spirit leaps and prances 
E'en then my soul with exultation dances 
For that to love so long I've dormant lain 
But when I see thee meek and kind and tender 
Heavens how desperately do I adore 
Thy winning graces to be thy defender 
I hotly burn to be a Calidore 
A very Red Cross Knight a stout Leander 
Might I be loved by thee like these of yore 
Light feet dark violet eyes and parted hair 
Soft dimpled hands white neck and creamy breast 
Are things on which the dazzled senses rest 
Till the fond fixed eyes forget they stare 
From such fine pictures heavens I cannot dare 
To turn my admiration though unpossess'd 
They be of what is worthy though not drest 
In lovely modesty and virtues rare 
Yet these I leave as thoughtless as a lark 
These lures I straight forget e'en ere I dine 
Or thrice my palate moisten but when I mark 
Such charms with mild intelligences shine 
My ear is open like a greedy shark 
To catch the tunings of a voice divine 
Ah who can e'er forget so fair a being 
Who can forget her half retiring sweets 
God she is like a milk white lamb that bleats 
For man's protection Surely the All seeing 
Who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing 
Will never give him pinions who intreats 
Such innocence to ruin who vilely cheats 
A dove like bosom In truth there is no freeing 
One's thoughts from such a beauty when I hear 
A lay that once I saw her hand awake 
Her form seems floating palpable and near 
Had I e'er seen her from an arbour take 
A dewy flower oft would that hand appear 
And o'er my eyes the trembling moisture shake 
Among the rest a shepheard though but young 
Yet hartned to his pipe with all the skill 
His few yeeres could began to fit his quill 
Sweet are the pleasures that to verse belong 
And doubly sweet a brotherhood in song 
Nor can remembrance Mathew bring to view 
A fate more pleasing a delight more true 
Than that in which the brother Poets joy'd 
Who with combined powers their wit employ'd 
To raise a trophy to the drama's muses 
The thought of this great partnership diffuses 
Over the genius loving heart a feeling 
Of all that's high and great and good and healing 
Too partial friend fain would I follow thee 
Past each horizon of fine poesy 
Fain would I echo back each pleasant note 
As o'er Sicilian seas clear anthems float 
'Mong the light skimming gondolas far parted 
Just when the sun his farewell beam has darted 
But 'tis impossible far different cares 
Beckon me sternly from soft Lydian airs 
And hold my faculties so long in thrall 
That I am oft in doubt whether at all 
I shall again see Phoebus in the morning 
Or flush'd Aurora in the roseate dawning 
Or a white Naiad in a rippling stream 
Or a rapt seraph in a moonlight beam 
Or again witness what with thee I've seen 
The dew by fairy feet swept from the green 
After a night of some quaint jubilee 
Which every elf and fay had come to see 
When bright processions took their airy march 
Beneath the curved moon's triumphal arch 
But might I now each passing moment give 
To the coy muse with me she would not live 
In this dark city nor would condescend 
'Mid contradictions her delights to lend 
Should e'er the fine eyed maid to me be kind 
Ah surely it must be whene'er I find 
Some flowery spot sequester'd wild romantic 
That often must have seen a poet frantic 
Where oaks that erst the Druid knew are growing 
And flowers the glory of one day are blowing 
Where the dark leav'd laburnum's drooping clusters 
Reflect athwart the stream their yellow lustres 
And intertwined the cassia's arms unite 
With its own drooping buds but very white 
Where on one side are covert branches hung 
'Mong which the nightingales have always sung 
In leafy quiet where to pry aloof 
Atween the pillars of the sylvan roof 
Would be to find where violet beds were nestling 
And where the bee with cowslip bells was wrestling 
There must be too a ruin dark and gloomy 
To say joy not too much in all that's bloomy 
Yet this is vain O Mathew lend thy aid 
To find a place where I may greet the maid 
Where we may soft humanity put on 
And sit and rhyme and think on Chatterton 
And that warm hearted Shakspeare sent to meet him 
Four laurell'd spirits heaven ward to intreat him 
With reverence would we speak of all the sages 
Who have left streaks of light athwart their ages 
And thou shouldst moralize on Milton's blindness 
And mourn the fearful dearth of human kindness 
To those who strove with the bright golden wing 
Of genius to flap away each sting 
Thrown by the pitiless world We next could tell 
Of those who in the cause of freedom fell 
Of our own Alfred of Helvetian Tell 
Of him whose name to ev'ry heart's a solace 
High minded and unbending William Wallace 
While to the rugged north our musing turns 
We well might drop a tear for him and Burns 
Felton without incitements such as these 
How vain for me the niggard Muse to tease 
For thee she will thy every dwelling grace 
And make a sun shine in a shady place 
For thou wast once a flowret blooming wild 
Close to the source bright pure and undefil'd 
Whence gush the streams of song in happy hour 
Came chaste Diana from her shady bower 
Just as the sun was from the east uprising 
And as for him some gift she was devising 
Beheld thee pluck'd thee cast thee in the stream 
To meet her glorious brother's greeting beam 
I marvel much that thou hast never told 
How from a flower into a fish of gold 
Apollo chang'd thee how thou next didst seem 
A black eyed swan upon the widening stream 
And when thou first didst in that mirror trace 
The placid features of a human face 
That thou hast never told thy travels strange 
And all the wonders of the mazy range 
O'er pebbly crystal and o'er golden sands 
Kissing thy daily food from Naiad's pearly hands 
Full many a dreary hour have I past 
My brain bewilder'd and my mind o'ercast 
With heaviness in seasons when I've thought 
No spherey strains by me could e'er be caught 
From the blue dome though I to dimness gaze 
On the far depth where sheeted lightning plays 
Or on the wavy grass outstretch'd supinely 
Pry 'mong the stars to strive to think divinely 
That I should never hear Apollo's song 
Though feathery clouds were floating all along 
The purple west and two bright streaks between 
The golden lyre itself were dimly seen 
That the still murmur of the honey bee 
Would never teach a rural song to me 
That the bright glance from beauty's eyelids slanting 
Would never make a lay of mine enchanting 
Or warm my breast with ardour to unfold 
Some tale of love and arms in time of old 
But there are times when those that love the bay 
Fly from all sorrowing far far away 
A sudden glow comes on them nought they see 
In water earth or air but poesy 
It has been said dear George and true I hold it 
For knightly Spenser to Libertas told it 
That when a Poet is in such a trance 
In air he sees white coursers paw and prance 
Bestridden of gay knights in gay apparel 
Who at each other tilt in playful quarrel 
And what we ignorantly sheet lightning call 
Is the swift opening of their wide portal 
When the bright warder blows his trumpet clear 
Whose tones reach nought on earth but Poet's ear 
When these enchanted portals open wide 
And through the light the horsemen swiftly glide 
The Poet's eye can reach those golden halls 
And view the glory of their festivals 
Their ladies fair that in the distance seem 
Fit for the silv'ring of a seraph's dream 
Their rich brimm'd goblets that incessant run 
Like the bright spots that move about the sun 
And when upheld the wine from each bright jar 
Pours with the lustre of a falling star 
Yet further off are dimly seen their bowers 
Of which no mortal eye can reach the flowers 
And 'tis right just for well Apollo knows 
'Twould make the Poet quarrel with the rose 
All that's reveal'd from that far seat of blisses 
Is the clear fountains' interchanging kisses 
As gracefully descending light and thin 
Like silver streaks across a dolphin's fin 
When he upswimmeth from the coral caves 
And sports with half his tail above the waves 
These wonders strange be sees and many more 
Whose head is pregnant with poetic lore 
Should he upon an evening ramble fare 
With forehead to the soothing breezes bare 
Would he naught see but the dark silent blue 
With all its diamonds trembling through and through 
Or the coy moon when in the waviness 
Of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress 
And staidly paces higher up and higher 
Like a sweet nun in holy day attire 
Ah yes much more would start into his sight 
The revelries and mysteries of night 
And should I ever see them I will tell you 
Such tales as needs must with amazement spell you 
These are the living pleasures of the bard 
But richer far posterity's award 
What does he murmur with his latest breath 
While his proud eye looks through the film of death 
What though I leave this dull and earthly mould 
Yet shall my spirit lofty converse hold 
With after times The patriot shall feel 
My stern alarum and unsheath his steel 
Or in the senate thunder out my numbers 
To startle princes from their easy slumbers 
The sage will mingle with each moral theme 
My happy thoughts sententious he will teem 
With lofty periods when my verses fire him 
And then I'll stoop from heaven to inspire him 
Lays have I left of such a dear delight 
That maids will sing them on their bridal night 
Gay villagers upon a morn of May 
When they have tired their gentle limbs with play 
And form'd a snowy circle on the grass 
And plac'd in midst of all that lovely lass 
Who chosen is their queen with her fine head 
Crowned with flowers purple white and red 
For there the lily and the musk rose sighing 
Are emblems true of hapless lovers dying 
Between her breasts that never yet felt trouble 
A bunch of violets full blown and double 
Serenely sleep she from a casket takes 
A little book and then a joy awakes 
About each youthful heart with stifled cries 
And rubbing of white hands and sparkling eyes 
For she's to read a tale of hopes and fears 
One that I foster'd in my youthful years 
The pearls that on each glist'ning circlet sleep 
Gush ever and anon with silent creep 
Lured by the innocent dimples To sweet rest 
Shall the dear babe upon its mother's breast 
Be lull'd with songs of mine Fair world adieu 
Thy dales and hills are fading from my view 
Swiftly I mount upon wide spreading pinions 
Far from the narrow bounds of thy dominions 
Full joy I feel while thus I cleave the air 
That my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair 
And warm thy sons Ah my dear friend and brother 
Could I at once my mad ambition smother 
For tasting joys like these sure I should be 
Happier and dearer to society 
At times 'tis true I've felt relief from pain 
When some bright thought has darted through my brain 
Through all that day I've felt a greater pleasure 
Than if I'd brought to light a hidden treasure 
As to my sonnets though none else should heed them 
I feel delighted still that you should read them 
Of late too I have had much calm enjoyment 
Stretch'd on the grass at my best lov'd employment 
Of scribbling lines for you These things I thought 
While in my face the freshest breeze I caught 
E'en now I'm pillow'd on a bed of flowers 
That crowns a lofty clift which proudly towers 
Above the ocean waves The stalks and blades 
Chequer my tablet with their quivering shades 
On one side is a field of drooping oats 
Through which the poppies show their scarlet coats 
So pert and useless that they bring to mind 
The scarlet coats that pester human kind 
And on the other side outspread is seen 
Ocean's blue mantle streak'd with purple and green 
Now 'tis I see a canvass'd ship and now 
Mark the bright silver curling round her prow 
I see the lark down dropping to his nest 
And the broad winged sea gull never at rest 
For when no more he spreads his feathers free 
His breast is dancing on the restless sea 
Now I direct my eyes into the west 
Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest 
Why westward turn 'Twas but to say adieu 
'Twas but to kiss my hand dear George to you 
Oft have you seen a swan superbly frowning 
And with proud breast his own white shadow crowning 
He slants his neck beneath the waters bright 
So silently it seems a beam of light 
Come from the galaxy anon he sports 
With outspread wings the Naiad Zephyr courts 
Or ruffles all the surface of the lake 
In striving from its crystal face to take 
Some diamond water drops and them to treasure 
In milky nest and sip them off at leisure 
But not a moment can he there insure them 
Nor to such downy rest can he allure them 
For down they rush as though they would be free 
And drop like hours into eternity 
Just like that bird am I in loss of time 
Whene'er I venture on the stream of rhyme 
With shatter'd boat oar snapt and canvass rent 
I slowly sail scarce knowing my intent 
Still scooping up the water with my fingers 
In which a trembling diamond never lingers 
By this friend Charles you may full plainly see 
Why I have never penn'd a line to thee 
Because my thoughts were never free and clear 
And little fit to please a classic ear 
Because my wine was of too poor a savour 
For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour 
Of sparkling Helicon small good it were 
To take him to a desert rude and bare 
Who had on Baiae's shore reclin'd at ease 
While Tasso's page was floating in a breeze 
That gave soft music from Armida's bowers 
Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers 
Small good to one who had by Mulla's stream 
Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream 
Who had beheld Belphoebe in a brook 
And lovely Una in a leafy nook 
And Archimago leaning o'er his book 
Who had of all that's sweet tasted and seen 
From silv'ry ripple up to beauty's queen 
From the sequester'd haunts of gay Titania 
To the blue dwelling of divine Urania 
One who of late had ta'en sweet forest walks 
With him who elegantly chats and talks 
The wrong'd Libert as who has told you stories 
Of laurel chaplets and Apollo's glories 
Of troops chivalrous prancing through a city 
And tearful ladies made for love and pity 
With many else which I have never known 
Thus have I thought and days on days have flown 
Slowly or rapidly unwilling still 
For you to try my dull unlearned quill 
Nor should I now but that I've known you long 
That you first taught me all the sweets of song 
The grand the sweet the terse the free the fine 
What swell'd with pathos and what right divine 
Spenserian vowels that elope with ease 
And float along like birds o'er summer seas 
Miltonian storms and more Miltonian tenderness 
Michael in arms and more meek Eve's fair slenderness 
Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly 
Up to its climax and then dying proudly 
Who found for me the grandeur of the ode 
Growing like Atlas stronger from its load 
Who let me taste that more than cordial dram 
The sharp the rapier pointed epigram 
Shew'd me that epic was of all the king 
Round vast and spanning all like Saturn's ring 
You too upheld the veil from Clio's beauty 
And pointed out the patriot's stern duty 
The might of Alfred and the shaft of Tell 
The hand of Brutus that so grandly fell 
Upon a tyrant's head Ah had I never seen 
Or known your kindness what might I have been 
What my enjoyments in my youthful years 
Bereft of all that now my life endears 
And can I e'er these benefits forget 
And can I e'er repay the friendly debt 
No doubly no yet should these rhymings please 
I shall roll on the grass with two fold ease 
For I have long time been my fancy feeding 
With hopes that you would one day think the reading 
Of my rough verses not an hour misspent 
Should it e'er be so what a rich content 
Some weeks have pass'd since last I saw the spires 
In lucent Thames reflected warm desires 
To see the sun o'er peep the eastern dimness 
And morning shadows streaking into slimness 
Across the lawny fields and pebbly water 
To mark the time as they grow broad and shorter 
To feel the air that plays about the hills 
And sips its freshness from the little rills 
To see high golden corn wave in the light 
When Cynthia smiles upon a summer's night 
And peers among the cloudlet's jet and white 
As though she were reclining in a bed 
Of bean blossoms in heaven freshly shed 
No sooner had I stepp'd into these pleasures 
Than I began to think of rhymes and measures 
The air that floated by me seem'd to say 
Write thou wilt never have a better day 
And so I did When many lines I'd written 
Though with their grace I was not oversmitten 
Yet as my hand was warm I thought I'd better 
Trust to my feelings and write you a letter 
Such an attempt required an inspiration 
Of a peculiar sort a consummation 
Which had I felt these scribblings might have been 
Verses from which the soul would never wean 
But many days have past since last my heart 
Was warm'd luxuriously by divine Mozart 
By Arne delighted or by Handel madden'd 
Or by the song of Erin pierc'd and sadden'd 
What time you were before the music sitting 
And the rich notes to each sensation fitting 
Since I have walk'd with you through shady lanes 
That freshly terminate in open plains 
And revel'd in a chat that ceased not 
When at night fall among your books we got 
No nor when supper came nor after that 
Nor when reluctantly I took my hat 
No nor till cordially you shook my hand 
Mid way between our homes your accents bland 
Still sounded in my ears when I no more 
Could hear your footsteps touch the grav'ly floor 
Sometimes I lost them and then found again 
You chang'd the footpath for the grassy plain 
In those still moments I have wish'd you joys 
That well you know to honour Life's very toys 
With him said I will take a pleasant charm 
It cannot be that ought will work him harm 
These thoughts now come o'er me with all their might 
Again I shake your hand friend Charles good night 
Many the wonders I this day have seen 
The sun when first he kist away the tears 
That fill'd the eyes of morn the laurel'd peers 
Who from the feathery gold of evening lean 
The ocean with its vastness its blue green 
Its ships its rocks its caves its hopes its fears 
Its voice mysterious which whoso hears 
Must think on what will be and what has been 
E'en now dear George while this for you I write 
Cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping 
So scantly that it seems her bridal night 
And she her half discover'd revels keeping 
But what without the social thought of thee 
Would be the wonders of the sky and sea 
Had I a man's fair form then might my sighs 
Be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell 
Thine ear and find thy gentle heart so well 
Would passion arm me for the enterprize 
But ah I am no knight whose foeman dies 
No cuirass glistens on my bosom's swell 
I am no happy shepherd of the dell 
Whose lips have trembled with a maiden's eyes 
Yet must I dote upon thee call thee sweet 
Sweeter by far than Hybla's honied roses 
When steep'd in dew rich to intoxication 
Ah I will taste that dew for me 'tis meet 
And when the moon her pallid face discloses 
I'll gather some by spells and incantation 
What though for showing truth to flatter'd state 
Kind Hunt was shut in prison yet has he 
In his immortal spirit been as free 
As the sky searching lark and as elate 
Minion of grandeur think you he did wait 
Think you he nought but prison walls did see 
Till so unwilling thou unturn'dst the key 
Ah no far happier nobler was his fate 
In Spenser's halls he strayed and bowers fair 
Culling enchanted flowers and he flew 
With daring Milton through the fields of air 
To regions of his own his genius true 
Took happy flights Who shall his fame impair 
When thou art dead and all thy wretched crew 
How many bards gild the lapses of time 
A few of them have ever been the food 
Of my delighted fancy I could brood 
Over their beauties earthly or sublime 
And often when I sit me down to rhyme 
These will in throngs before my mind intrude 
But no confusion no disturbance rude 
Do they occasion 'tis a pleasing chime 
So the unnumber'd sounds that evening store 
The songs of birds the whisp'ring of the leaves 
The voice of waters the great bell that heaves 
With solemn sound and thousand others more 
That distance of recognizance bereaves 
Make pleasing music and not wild uproar 
As late I rambled in the happy fields 
What time the sky lark shakes the tremulous dew 
From his lush clover covert when anew 
Adventurous knights take up their dinted shields 
I saw the sweetest flower wild nature yields 
A fresh blown musk rose 'twas the first that threw 
Its sweets upon the summer graceful it grew 
As is the wand that queen Titania wields 
And as I feasted on its fragrancy 
I thought the garden rose it far excell'd 
But when O Wells thy roses came to me 
My sense with their deliciousness was spell'd 
Soft voices had they that with tender plea 
Whisper'd of peace and truth and friendliness unquell'd 
Nymph of the downward smile and sidelong glance 
In what diviner moments of the day 
Art thou most lovely When gone far astray 
Into the labyrinths of sweet utterance 
Or when serenely wand'ring in a trance 
Of sober thought Or when starting away 
With careless robe to meet the morning ray 
Thou spar'st the flowers in thy mazy dance 
Haply 'tis when thy ruby lips part sweetly 
And so remain because thou listenest 
But thou to please wert nurtured so completely 
That I can never tell what mood is best 
I shall as soon pronounce which grace more neatly 
Trips it before Apollo than the rest 
O Solitude if I must with thee dwell 
Let it not be among the jumbled heap 
Of murky buildings climb with me the steep 
Nature's observatory whence the dell 
Its flowery slopes its river's crystal swell 
May seem a span let me thy vigils keep 
'Mongst boughs pavillion'd where the deer's swift leap 
Startles the wild bee from the fox glove bell 
But though I'll gladly trace these scenes with thee 
Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind 
Whose words are images of thoughts refin'd 
Is my soul's pleasure and it sure must be 
Almost the highest bliss of human kind 
When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee 
Small busy flames play through the fresh laid coals 
And their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep 
Like whispers of the household gods that keep 
A gentle empire o'er fraternal souls 
And while for rhymes I search around the poles 
Your eyes are fix'd as in poetic sleep 
Upon the lore so voluble and deep 
That aye at fall of night our care condoles 
This is your birth day Tom and I rejoice 
That thus it passes smoothly quietly 
Many such eves of gently whisp'ring noise 
May we together pass and calmly try 
What are this world's true joys ere the great voice 
From its fair face shall bid our spirits fly 
Keen fitful gusts are whisp'ring here and there 
Among the bushes half leafless and dry 
The stars look very cold about the sky 
And I have many miles on foot to fare 
Yet feel I little of the cool bleak air 
Or of the dead leaves rustling drearily 
Or of those silver lamps that burn on high 
Or of the distance from home's pleasant lair 
For I am brimfull of the friendliness 
That in a little cottage I have found 
Of fair hair'd Milton's eloquent distress 
And all his love for gentle Lycid drown'd 
Of lovely Laura in her light green dress 
And faithful Petrarch gloriously crown'd 
To one who has been long in city pent 
'Tis very sweet to look into the fair 
And open face of heaven to breathe a prayer 
Full in the smile of the blue firmament 
Who is more happy when with hearts content 
Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair 
Of wavy grass and reads a debonair 
And gentle tale of love and languishment 
Returning home at evening with an ear 
Catching the notes of Philomel an eye 
Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career 
He mourns that day so soon has glided by 
E'en like the passage of an angel's tear 
That falls through the clear ether silently 
Much have I traveled in the realms of gold 
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen 
Round many western islands have I been 
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold 
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told 
That deep brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne 
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene 
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold 
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies 
When a new planet swims into his ken 
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes 
He star'd at the Pacific and all his men 
Look'd at each other with a wild surmise 
Silent upon a peak in Darien 
Give me a golden pen and let me lean 
On heap'd up flowers in regions clear and far 
Bring me a tablet whiter than a star 
Or hand of hymning angel when 'tis seen 
The silver strings of heavenly harp atween 
And let there glide by many a pearly car 
Pink robes and wavy hair and diamond jar 
And half discovered wings and glances keen 
The while let music wander round my ears 
And as it reaches each delicious ending 
Let me write down a line of glorious tone 
And full of many wonders of the spheres 
For what a height my spirit is contending 
'Tis not content so soon to be alone 
Highmindedness a jealousy for good 
A loving kindness for the great man's fame 
Dwells here and there with people of no name 
In noisome alley and in pathless wood 
And where we think the truth least understood 
Oft may be found a singleness of aim 
That ought to frighten into hooded shame 
A money mong'ring pitiable brood 
How glorious this affection for the cause 
Of stedfast genius toiling gallantly 
What when a stout unbending champion awes 
Envy and Malice to their native sty 
Unnumber'd souls breathe out a still applause 
Proud to behold him in his country's eye 
Great spirits now on earth are sojourning 
He of the cloud the cataract the lake 
Who on Helvellyn's summit wide awake 
Catches his freshness from Archangel's wing 
He of the rose the violet the spring 
The social smile the chain for Freedom's sake 
And lo whose stedfastness would never take 
A meaner sound than Raphael's whispering 
And other spirits there are standing apart 
Upon the forehead of the age to come 
These these will give the world another heart 
And other pulses Hear ye not the hum 
Of mighty workings 
Listen awhile ye nations and be dumb 
The poetry of earth is never dead 
When all the birds are faint with the hot sun 
And hide in cooling trees a voice will run 
From hedge to hedge about the new mown mead 
That is the Grasshopper's he takes the lead 
In summer luxury he has never done 
With his delights for when tired out with fun 
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed 
The poetry of earth is ceasing never 
On a lone winter evening when the frost 
Has wrought a silence from the stove there shrills 
The Cricket's song in warmth increasing ever 
And seems to one in drowsiness half lost 
The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills 
Good Kosciusko thy great name alone 
Is a full harvest whence to reap high feeling 
It comes upon us like the glorious pealing 
Of the wide spheres an everlasting tone 
And now it tells me that in worlds unknown 
The names of heroes burst from clouds concealing 
And changed to harmonies for ever stealing 
Through cloudless blue and round each silver throne 
It tells me too that on a happy day 
When some good spirit walks upon the earth 
Thy name with Alfred's and the great of yore 
Gently commingling gives tremendous birth 
To a loud hymn that sounds far far away 
To where the great God lives for evermore 
Happy is England I could be content 
To see no other verdure than its own 
To feel no other breezes than are blown 
Through its tall woods with high romances blent 
Yet do I sometimes feel a languishment 
For skies Italian and an inward groan 
To sit upon an Alp as on a throne 
And half forget what world or worldling meant 
Happy is England sweet her artless daughters 
Enough their simple loveliness for me 
Enough their whitest arms in silence clinging 
Yet do I often warmly burn to see 
Beauties of deeper glance and hear their singing 
And float with them about the summer waters 
As I lay in my bed slepe full unmete 
Was unto me but why that I ne might 
Rest I ne wist for there n'as erthly wight 
As I suppose had more of hertis ese 
Than I for I n'ad sicknesse nor disese 
What is more gentle than a wind in summer 
What is more soothing than the pretty hummer 
That stays one moment in an open flower 
And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower 
What is more tranquil than a musk rose blowing 
In a green island far from all men's knowing 
More healthful than the leafiness of dales 
More secret than a nest of nightingales 
More serene than Cordelia's countenance 
More full of visions than a high romance 
What but thee Sleep Soft closer of our eyes 
Low murmurer of tender lullabies 
Light hoverer around our happy pillows 
Wreather of poppy buds and weeping willows 
Silent entangler of a beauty's tresses 
Most happy listener when the morning blesses 
Thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes 
That glance so brightly at the new sun rise 
But what is higher beyond thought than thee 
Fresher than berries of a mountain tree 
More strange more beautiful more smooth more regal 
Than wings of swans than doves than dim seen eagle 
What is it And to what shall I compare it 
It has a glory and nought else can share it 
The thought thereof is awful sweet and holy 
Chacing away all worldliness and folly 
Coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder 
Or the low rumblings earth's regions under 
And sometimes like a gentle whispering 
Of all the secrets of some wond'rous thing 
That breathes about us in the vacant air 
So that we look around with prying stare 
Perhaps to see shapes of light aerial lymning 
And catch soft floatings from a faint heard hymning 
To see the laurel wreath on high suspended 
That is to crown our name when life is ended 
Sometimes it gives a glory to the voice 
And from the heart up springs rejoice rejoice 
Sounds which will reach the Framer of all things 
And die away in ardent mutterings 
No one who once the glorious sun has seen 
And all the clouds and felt his bosom clean 
For his great Maker's presence but must know 
What 'tis I mean and feel his being glow 
Therefore no insult will I give his spirit 
By telling what he sees from native merit 
O Poesy for thee I hold my pen 
That am not yet a glorious denizen 
Of thy wide heaven Should I rather kneel 
Upon some mountain top until I feel 
A glowing splendour round about me hung 
And echo back the voice of thine own tongue 
O Poesy for thee I grasp my pen 
That am not yet a glorious denizen 
Of thy wide heaven yet to my ardent prayer 
Yield from thy sanctuary some clear air 
Smoothed for intoxication by the breath 
Of flowering bays that I may die a death 
Of luxury and my young spirit follow 
The morning sun beams to the great Apollo 
Like a fresh sacrifice or if I can bear 
The o'erwhelming sweets 'twill bring to me the fair 
Visions of all places a bowery nook 
Will be elysium an eternal book 
Whence I may copy many a lovely saying 
About the leaves and flowers about the playing 
Of nymphs in woods and fountains and the shade 
Keeping a silence round a sleeping maid 
And many a verse from so strange influence 
That we must ever wonder how and whence 
It came Also imaginings will hover 
Round my fire side and haply there discover 
Vistas of solemn beauty where I'd wander 
In happy silence like the clear meander 
Through its lone vales and where I found a spot 
Of awfuller shade or an enchanted grot 
Or a green hill o'erspread with chequered dress 
Of flowers and fearful from its loveliness 
Write on my tablets all that was permitted 
All that was for our human senses fitted 
Then the events of this wide world I'd seize 
Like a strong giant and my spirit teaze 
Till at its shoulders it should proudly see 
Wings to find out an immortality 
Stop and consider life is but a day 
A fragile dew drop on its perilous way 
From a tree's summit a poor Indian's sleep 
While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep 
Of Montmorenci Why so sad a moan 
Life is the rose's hope while yet unblown 
The reading of an ever changing tale 
The light uplifting of a maiden's veil 
A pigeon tumbling in clear summer air 
A laughing school boy without grief or care 
Riding the springy branches of an elm 
O for ten years that I may overwhelm 
Myself in poesy so I may do the deed 
That my own soul has to itself decreed 
Then will I pass the countries that I see 
In long perspective and continually 
Taste their pure fountains First the realm I'll pass 
Of Flora and old Pan sleep in the grass 
Feed upon apples red and strawberries 
And choose each pleasure that my fancy sees 
Catch the white handed nymphs in shady places 
To woo sweet kisses from averted faces 
Play with their fingers touch their shoulders white 
Into a pretty shrinking with a bite 
As hard as lips can make it till agreed 
A lovely tale of human life we'll read 
And one will teach a tame dove how it best 
May fan the cool air gently o'er my rest 
Another bending o'er her nimble tread 
Will set a green robe floating round her head 
And still will dance with ever varied case 
Smiling upon the flowers and the trees 
Another will entice me on and on 
Through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon 
Till in the bosom of a leafy world 
We rest in silence like two gems upcurl'd 
In the recesses of a pearly shell 
And can I ever bid these joys farewell 
Yes I must pass them for a nobler life 
Where I may find the agonies the strife 
Of human hearts for lo I see afar 
O'er sailing the blue cragginess a car 
And steeds with streamy manes the charioteer 
Looks out upon the winds with glorious fear 
And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly 
Along a huge cloud's ridge and now with sprightly 
Wheel downward come they into fresher skies 
Tipt round with silver from the sun's bright eyes 
Still downward with capacious whirl they glide 
And now I see them on a green hill's side 
In breezy rest among the nodding stalks 
The charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks 
To the trees and mountains and there soon appear 
Shapes of delight of mystery and fear 
Passing along before a dusky space 
Made by some mighty oaks as they would chase 
Some ever fleeting music on they sweep 
Lo how they murmur laugh and smile and weep 
Some with upholden hand and mouth severe 
Some with their faces muffled to the ear 
Between their arms some clear in youthful bloom 
Go glad and smilingly athwart the gloom 
Some looking back and some with upward gaze 
Yes thousands in a thousand different ways 
Flit onward now a lovely wreath of girls 
Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls 
And now broad wings Most awfully intent 
The driver of those steeds is forward bent 
And seems to listen O that I might know 
All that he writes with such a hurrying glow 
The visions all are fled the car is fled 
Into the light of heaven and in their stead 
A sense of real things comes doubly strong 
And like a muddy stream would bear along 
My soul to nothingness but I will strive 
Against all doublings and will keep alive 
The thought of that same chariot and the strange 
Journey it went 
Is there so small a range 
In the present strength of manhood that the high 
Imagination cannot freely fly 
As she was wont of old prepare her steeds 
Paw up against the light and do strange deeds 
Upon the clouds Has she not shewn us all 
From the clear space of ether to the small 
Breath of new buds unfolding From the meaning 
Of Jove's large eye brow to the tender greening 
Of April meadows Here her altar shone 
E'en in this isle and who could paragon 
The fervid choir that lifted up a noise 
Of harmony to where it aye will poise 
Its mighty self of convoluting sound 
Huge as a planet and like that roll round 
Eternally around a dizzy void 
Ay in those days the Muses were nigh cloy'd 
With honors nor had any other care 
Than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair 
Could all this be forgotten Yes a schism 
Nurtured by foppery and barbarism 
Made great Apollo blush for this his land 
Men were thought wise who could not understand 
His glories with a puling infant's force 
They sway'd about upon a rocking horse 
And thought it Pegasus Ah dismal soul'd 
The winds of heaven blew the ocean roll'd 
Its gathering waves ye felt it not The blue 
Bared its eternal bosom and the dew 
Of summer nights collected still to make 
The morning precious beauty was awake 
Why were ye not awake But ye were dead 
To things ye knew not of were closely wed 
To musty laws lined out with wretched rule 
And compass vile so that ye taught a school 
Of dolts to smooth inlay and clip and fit 
Till like the certain wands of Jacob's wit 
Their verses tallied Easy was the task 
A thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask 
Of Poesy Ill fated impious race 
That blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face 
And did not know it no they went about 
Holding a poor decrepid standard out 
Mark'd with most flimsy mottos and in large 
The name of one Boileau 
O ye whose charge 
It is to hover round our pleasant hills 
Whose congregated majesty so fills 
My boundly reverence that I cannot trace 
Your hallowed names in this unholy place 
So near those common folk did not their shames 
Affright you Did our old lamenting Thames 
Delight you Did ye never cluster round 
Delicious Avon with a mournful sound 
And weep Or did ye wholly bid adieu 
To regions where no more the laurel grew 
Or did ye stay to give a welcoming 
To some lone spirits who could proudly sing 
Their youth away and die 'Twas even so 
But let me think away those times of woe 
Now 'tis a fairer season ye have breathed 
Rich benedictions o'er us ye have wreathed 
Fresh garlands for sweet music has been heard 
In many places some has been upstirr'd 
From out its crystal dwelling in a lake 
By a swan's ebon bill from a thick brake 
Nested and quiet in a valley mild 
Bubbles a pipe fine sounds are floating wild 
About the earth happy are ye and glad 
These things are doubtless yet in truth we've had 
Strange thunders from the potency of song 
Mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong 
From majesty but in clear truth the themes 
Are ugly clubs the Poets Polyphemes 
Disturbing the grand sea A drainless shower 
Of light is poesy 'tis the supreme of power 
'Tis might half slumb'ring on its own right arm 
The very archings of her eye lids charm 
A thousand willing agents to obey 
And still she governs with the mildest sway 
But strength alone though of the Muses born 
Is like a fallen angel trees uptorn 
Darkness and worms and shrouds and sepulchres 
Delight it for it feeds upon the burrs 
And thorns of life forgetting the great end 
Of poesy that it should be a friend 
To sooth the cares and lift the thoughts of man 
Yet I rejoice a myrtle fairer than 
E'er grew in Paphos from the bitter weeds 
Lifts its sweet head into the air and feeds 
A silent space with ever sprouting green 
All tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen 
Creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering 
Nibble the little cupped flowers and sing 
Then let us clear away the choaking thorns 
From round its gentle stem let the young fawns 
Yeaned in after times when we are flown 
Find a fresh sward beneath it overgrown 
With simple flowers let there nothing be 
More boisterous than a lover's bended knee 
Nought more ungentle than the placid look 
Of one who leans upon a closed book 
Nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes 
Between two hills All hail delightful hopes 
As she was wont th' imagination 
Into most lovely labyrinths will be gone 
And they shall be accounted poet kings 
Who simply tell the most heart easing things 
O may these joys be ripe before I die 
Will not some say that I presumptuously 
Have spoken that from hastening disgrace 
'Twere better far to hide my foolish face 
That whining boyhood should with reverence bow 
Ere the dread thunderbolt could reach How 
If I do hide myself it sure shall be 
In the very fane the light of Poesy 
If I do fall at least I will be laid 
Beneath the silence of a poplar shade 
And over me the grass shall be smooth shaven 
And there shall be a kind memorial graven 
But oft' Despondence miserable bane 
They should not know thee who athirst to gain 
A noble end are thirsty every hour 
What though I am not wealthy in the dower 
Of spanning wisdom though I do not know 
The shiftings of the mighty winds that blow 
Hither and thither all the changing thoughts 
Of man though no great minist'ring reason sorts 
Out the dark mysteries of human souls 
To clear conceiving yet there ever rolls 
A vast idea before me and I glean 
Therefrom my liberty thence too I've seen 
The end and aim of Poesy 'Tis clear 
As any thing most true as that the year 
Is made of the four seasons manifest 
As a large cross some old cathedral's crest 
Lifted to the white clouds Therefore should I 
Be but the essence of deformity 
A coward did my very eye lids wink 
At speaking out what I have dared to think 
Ah rather let me like a madman run 
Over some precipice let the hot sun 
Melt my Dedalian wings and drive me down 
Convuls'd and headlong Stay an inward frown 
Of conscience bids me be more calm awhile 
An ocean dim sprinkled with many an isle 
Spreads awfully before me How much toil 
How many days what desperate turmoil 
Ere I can have explored its widenesses 
Ah what a task upon my bended knees 
I could unsay those no impossible 
Impossible 
For sweet relief I'll dwell 
On humbler thoughts and let this strange assay 
Begun in gentleness die so away 
E'en now all tumult from my bosom fades 
I turn full hearted to the friendly aids 
That smooth the path of honour brotherhood 
And friendliness the nurse of mutual good 
The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet 
Into the brain ere one can think upon it 
The silence when some rhymes are coming out 
And when they're come the very pleasant rout 
The message certain to be done to morrow 
'Tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow 
Some precious book from out its snug retreat 
To cluster round it when we next shall meet 
Scarce can I scribble on for lovely airs 
Are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs 
Many delights of that glad day recalling 
When first my senses caught their tender falling 
And with these airs come forms of elegance 
Stooping their shoulders o'er a horse's prance 
Careless and grand fingers soft and round 
Parting luxuriant curls and the swift bound 
Of Bacchus from his chariot when his eye 
Made Ariadne's cheek look blushingly 
Thus I remember all the pleasant flow 
Of words at opening a portfolio 
Things such as these are ever harbingers 
To trains of peaceful images the stirs 
Of a swan's neck unseen among the rushes 
A linnet starting all about the bushes 
A butterfly with golden wings broad parted 
Nestling a rose convuls'd as though it smarted 
With over pleasure many many more 
Might I indulge at large in all my store 
Of luxuries yet I must not forget 
Sleep quiet with his poppy coronet 
For what there may be worthy in these rhymes 
I partly owe to him and thus the chimes 
Of friendly voices had just given place 
To as sweet a silence when I 'gan retrace 
The pleasant day upon a couch at ease 
It was a poet's house who keeps the keys 
Of pleasure's temple Round about were hung 
The glorious features of the bards who sung 
In other ages cold and sacred busts 
Smiled at each other Happy he who trusts 
To clear Futurity his darling fame 
Then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim 
At swelling apples with a frisky leap 
And reaching fingers 'mid a luscious heap 
Of vine leaves Then there rose to view a fane 
Of liny marble and thereto a train 
Of nymphs approaching fairly o'er the sward 
One loveliest holding her white band toward 
The dazzling sun rise two sisters sweet 
Bending their graceful figures till they meet 
Over the trippings of a little child 
And some are hearing eagerly the wild 
Thrilling liquidity of dewy piping 
See in another picture nymphs are wiping 
Cherishingly Diana's timorous limbs 
A fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims 
At the bath's edge and keeps a gentle motion 
With the subsiding crystal as when ocean 
Heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothiness o'er 
Its rocky marge and balances once more 
The patient weeds that now unshent by foam 
Feel all about their undulating home 
Sappho's meek head was there half smiling down 
At nothing just as though the earnest frown 
Of over thinking had that moment gone 
From off her brow and left her all alone 
Great Alfred's too with anxious pitying eyes 
As if he always listened to the sighs 
Of the goaded world and Kosciusko's worn 
By horrid suffrance mightily forlorn 
Petrarch outstepping from the shady green 
Starts at the sight of Laura nor can wean 
His eyes from her sweet face Most happy they 
For over them was seen a free display 
Of out spread wings and from between them shone 
The face of Poesy from off her throne 
She overlook'd things that I scarce could tell 
The very sense of where I was might well 
Keep Sleep aloof but more than that there came 
Thought after thought to nourish up the flame 
Within my breast so that the morning light 
Surprised me even from a sleepless night 
And up I rose refresh'd and glad and gay 
Resolving to begin that very day 
These lines and howsoever they be done 
I leave them as a father does his son
